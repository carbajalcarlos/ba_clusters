Abstract = {{Worldwide, management systems invest strongly on the concepts of
   innovation and creativity, two pillars necessary for the advancement of
   any modern economy. These two concepts play a strategic role in the
   evolution of any organization, defining its competitive advantages and
   thus securing its future survival. Here, in this chapter, we examine
   them in the light of the public sector and especially in the area of
   educational organizations management. We investigate under which
   circumstances they emerge, how they flourish or fail, and what impact
   they have on the daily operations of a PSEO. These concepts are dynamic,
   so the corresponding phenomena are discussed using analytical as well as
   discrete methodologies. We focus our attention on policies and
   strategies developed by the public sector, in the frame of e-government
   initiatives, so as to prepare the organizations for competition in the
   digital future. Finally, we propose a methodology appropriate for
   transforming a typical conservative PSEO into a modern,
   innovation-endorsing, and sustainable business model. It is important to
   aim at and describe in detail a step-by-step process that leads smoothly
   to the new situation, avoiding incongruities and disruptions. This is
   depicted in a roadmap sketched using the basic concepts embedded on a
   transition diagram. The work ends by wrapping up a psychological profile
   appropriate to cultivate to all PSEO stakeholders, in order to manage to
   administer changes of this magnitude and importance.}},

Abstract = {{BitTorrent is the most popular peer-to-peer (P2P) content delivery
   application where individual users share various types of content with
   tens of thousands of other users. The growing popularity of BitTorrent
   is primarily due to the availability of valuable content without any
   cost for the consumers. However, apart from the required resources,
   publishing valuable (and often copyrighted) content has serious legal
   implications for the users who publish the material. This raises the
   question that whether (at least major) content publishers behave in an
   altruistic fashion or have other motives such as financial incentives.
   In this paper, we identify the content publishers of more than 55 K
   torrents in two major BitTorrent portals and examine their
   characteristics. We discover that around 100 publishers are responsible
   for publishing 67\% of the content, which corresponds to 75\% of the
   downloads. Our investigation reveals several key insights about major
   publishers. First, antipiracy agencies and malicious users publish
   ``fake{''} files to protect copyrighted content and spread malware,
   respectively. Second, excluding the fake publishers, content publishing
   in major BitTorrent portals appears to be largely driven by companies
   that try to attract consumers to their own Web sites for financial gain.
   Finally, we demonstrate that profit-driven publishers attract more loyal
   consumers than altruistic top publishers, whereas the latter have a
   larger fraction of loyal consumers with a higher degree of loyalty than
   the former.}},

Abstract = {{The high costs of American health care, the related problem of the
   uninsured, and the grim fiscal prognosis of Medicare and Medicaid are
   among the most pressing challenges facing the United States today. A
   solution to the cost problem that does not reduce access or quality is
   sought by those at all points on the political spectrum. This article
   discusses the experience of an independent practice association that has
   collaborated with a related business partner and a health plan to
   improve the quality of care of 16,000 Medicare Advantage beneficiaries
   while substantially reducing hospitalization rates and overall service
   use. The capacity to reduce service use frees funds that are used to
   support the infrastructure for high-value care and to reward those who
   provide it. Higher performing primary care, supported by changes in
   payment, has driven a sustainable business model that preserves the
   option of independent practice for physicians. We are now testing
   competencies developed for Medicare Advantage in the Pioneer Accountable
   Care Organization program, which preserves the broad patient choice that
   is an important feature of traditional Medicare.}},

Abstract = {{The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), founded in 1906, is an agency
   of the US Department of Health and Human Services, an executive
   department of the United States Government and responsible for
   regulating and supervising prescription and over-the-counter drugs,
   vaccines, and biopharmaceuticals. The FDAs Center for Drug Evaluation
   and Research is responsible for approving three types of ethical drugs:
   new drugs ('new drug applications' or `biologics licensing
   applications'), generic drugs and over-the-counter drugs. A drug that is
   approved by the FDA is deemed `safe and effective when used as
   directed'. While the FDA deserves greater scrutiny of its drug
   regulatory review process (amended under the FDA Modernization Act of
   1997) as it pertains to the approval of drugs for gravely ill patients,
   criticism of the agency's overall safety record has less to do with the
   reduction of approvals of new drugs over the last decade than an
   evolution in the pharmaceutical industry business model, one based on a
   different allocation of R\&D financial investment in drug product
   development portfolios. From an innovation strategy vantage point, many
   pharmaceutical companies are now re-focusing R\&D efforts on commercial
   capabilities, thus recognizing that incremental innovation, in the form
   of drug reformulations, or new drug indications, in the form of
   repurposed drugs, strategically complements the occasionally successful
   `blockbuster' drug.}},

Abstract = {{This Note analyzes the current antitrust regulatory framework for high
   tech, iteratively evolving computer and software systems. This issue has
   significant implications for the current economy as many modern
   technology companies base their entire business model on such systems.
   This Note examines the problems concerning software patents through an
   analysis of two well-known mobile phone operating systems: Apple's iOS
   and Google's Android.
   This Note also examines the current regulatory framework that prevents
   large companies from taking anticompetitive actions to expand their
   power in fast-moving high tech markets at the expense of smaller
   competitors specifically tying, predatory innovation, refusal to deal or
   license, sham litigation, and overbroad software patents. This Note also
   proposes several changes to both antitrust and patent laws that will
   make it more difficult for established market players to prevent new
   competitors from entering high tech markets, thereby promoting greater
   openness and innovation. These changes include modernizing sham
   litigation, reducing the number of patent infringement actions by
   allowing reverse engineering of software patent and an independent
   invention defense, and increased scrutiny of the business improvements
   antitrust defense.
   Each of these proposed changes targets the promotion of innovation by
   enabling the entry of new players into established markets without the
   threat of expensive litigation constantly undermining the compatibility
   and efficiency of the products that they attempt to bring to market.}},

Abstract = {{The responsibility of hospitals is changing. Those activities that were
   once confined within the walls of the medical facility have largely
   shifted outside them, yet the requirements for hospitals have only grown
   in scope. With the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care
   Act (ACA) and the development of accountable care organizations,
   financial incentives are focused on care coordination, and a hospital's
   responsibility now includes postdischarge outcomes. As a result,
   hospitals need to adjust their business model to accommodate their
   increased need to impact postacute care settings.
   A home care service line can fulfill this role for hospitals, serving as
   an effective conduit to the postdischarge realm serving as both a
   potential profit center and a risk mitigation offering. An alliance
   between home care agencies and hospitals can help improve clinical
   outcomes, provide the necessary care for communities, and establish a
   potentially profitable product line.}},

Abstract = {{Richard Gelfond knew little about the movie business when he and a
   partner acquired IMAX, back in 1994. At the time, most IMAX movies were
   nature documentaries, shown in the theaters of science museums, but he
   recognized that the entertainment experience the company provided had
   great pottntial. Figuring out how to move into mainstream markets turned
   out to be far more challenging than Gelfond had anticipated, however.
   The technology constraints of the predigital era and the cultural
   constraints of the Hollywood movie industry combined to slow MAX'S
   progress toward the successful business model it relies on today.
   At one point in 2001, the stock was trading at 55 cents a share, and
   some bondholders tried to force IMAX into bankruptcy. In 2006 Gelfond
   and his team actively tried to sell it. But doubts about its survival
   faded in 2009 particularly after the IMAx version of Avatar became a
   global phenomenon, bringing S250 million in revenue to the company.}},

Abstract = {{Consumers would like to have drugs that are of consistent quality and at
   the lowest price. However, with Pharma's current business model
   considerable effort is needed to maintain product quality and there are
   conflicts. Focus of the current pharma business model is invent a new
   molecule, commercialize and abandon i.e. let the generics take over when
   the patent expires. Due to less than efficient manufacturing
   technologies considerable effort is needed to maintain quality and
   comply with regulatory requirements. Even with this effort companies
   come short as evident by recent recalls and consent decrees. Making a
   grass root change in process development and manufacturing practices can
   easily eliminate these conflicts. One has to understand and exploit
   physical and chemical behavior of chemicals (sociochemicology) of the
   chemicals involved and produced in the manufacture of active
   ingredients. Creative application of unit processes and operations is
   equally important. Such processes not will produce quality product but
   will have lower manufacturing cost (higher profit), will be safe and
   sustainable.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The case study centers on the ways in which a world-renowned
   beauty pageant is deployed as a strategic asset by the Organizacion
   Cisneros (OC), a major player among Latin American television companies.
   The Miss Venezuela (MV) beauty contest has iconic status in Venezuela
   and enjoys an international reputation. Following the election of
   President Chavez in 1998 the OC gradually scaled-down its operations in
   Venezuela. Adriana Cisneros, OC Vice President, turned MV into a key
   element of the Corporate Social Responsibility strategy at Venevision,
   the TV channel founded by her grandfather. She also sought ways to build
   on the MV brand, in order to strengthen the OC's business strategy.
   Design/methodology/approach - The case study employs an inductive
   methodology, using a comprehensive approach to develop a teaching case
   study. It focusses on understanding a concrete business situation
   presented within a detailed contextual analysis. Findings Complex
   business and strategic decision making calls for a thorough analysis of
   internal business variables and a deep understanding of complex
   environmental forces.
   Originality/value - The comprehensive approach and detailed information
   presented in this case study constitute a versatile resource that will
   be useful for teaching topics including strategy, innovation, and

Title = {{INDUSTRIALIZING PARKING MANAGEMENT: EVIDENCES FROM THE PARK-ID PROJECT}},
Booktitle = {{UCLA ANDERSON BUSINESS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES (BIT) PROJECT: A
   GLOBAL STUDY OF BUSINESS PRACTICE (2012)}},
Year = {{2013}},
Pages = {{207-223}},
Abstract = {{The purpose of the chapter is to move forward into the understanding of
   the future of the parking management as a consequence of a more
   integrated and innovative business model enabled by the ICTs
   (Information and Communication Technology). The investigated case
   relates to the adoption of the RFID (Radio Frequency Identification)
   technology and shows the potential benefit of adopting in the very short
   term this technology as a powerful tool for enabling a more proactive
   transport demand management.
   The chapter is part of a larger research project called ``The Future of
   Service{''}, that, analyzing cases in consumer services within many
   industries (entertainment, banking and financial services, accommodation
   and hotels, education and mobility), is mapping the dynamics of services
   industrialization strategies adopted by companies and depicting the
   potential impact of the adoption of these strategies on their
   operations, and mainly on the trade-off between customization and
   standardization.
   As far as this specific chapter, the Park ID project is demonstrating a
   more integrated and innovative approach than the previous experiences we
   shortly list in the work. Many constraints have to be considered for a
   full implementation of the architectural innovation we have designed,
   but, as a matter of fact, it has a high potential of both reducing
   congestion and generating a new perspective business for parking
   management.
   The chapter represents a first step in conceptualizing the impact of the
   adoption of RFID technology within the parking management context and
   using it as a flexible, scalable and affordable platform for a more
   integrated transport demand management in big cities, in Europe at
   least. Other cases should be investigated to compare results across
   countries and cities for an increased generalizability of results.
   This study provides an original perspective on the expected innovation
   in a very neglected context, despite its impact on the quality of life
   of the majority of the urban areas in the world. From the scientific
   standpoint, it is contributing in reinforcing our forthcoming model on
   the mapping of the service industrialization strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs) are transient networks formed
   dynamically by a collection of arbitrarily located wireless mobile nodes
   without relying on any existing network infrastructure or centralized
   administration. They are either stand alone or connected to a fixed
   infrastructure such as 3G. They are useful in situations such as natural
   disasters, and their use is gaining more and more momentum. This paper
   proposes a framework for service provisioning in stand-alone MANETs. It
   focuses on the invocation and execution phases of the service life
   cycle. The framework is based on SIP servlets and comprises a novel
   business model and an overlay network. The business model enables
   service invocation and execution. The overlay network is used for
   service execution and is based on a distributed SIP servlets engine.
   Validation aspects are also discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper discusses different ways for the exchange of knowledge in
   networks - within, between, and without institutions, as well as their
   implication on networks in economy and society. Network systems based on
   technologies and architectures of participation offer a new model of
   online knowledge sharing, cooperation, and collaboration, that are
   different from the traditional institutional framework. This paper
   suggests that this model opens new horizons for both companies and
   non-profit organizations. By developing an e-networked business model,
   companies can make as much or even more money in the long tail of power
   low distribution than they were making at the head of the curve in the
   traditional business model. This opens to everyone the possibility of
   participating and contributing content, nonprofit organization and
   online communities, including Communities of Practice and online
   learning communities, which can ensure reaching the ``critical mass{''}
   of contributors and involvement level that will keep these communities
   active. This paper concludes with an example illustrating how the ideas
   discussed could facilitate knowledge exchange in companies,
   organizations or educational institutions.}},

   able to develop business and IT strategies. This chapter presents the
   resource-based theory of the firm, the knowledge-based theory of the
   firm, and the activity-based theory of the firm. With the widespread
   adoption of Internet technologies by firms, e-business models have
   emerged as a significant mechanism for service business. Both business
   and e-business models represent the commercial implementations of the
   business strategies chosen by the firms. This chapter, therefore,
   reviews the firm with a service orientation in terms of its value

Year = {{2013}},
Pages = {{141-157}},
Abstract = {{This chapter introduces a new approach to innovation, based on
   identifying the key assumptions in the prevailing business model of the
   firm or the industry and discarding a few key assumptions supporting the
   existing business model that are widely accepted within the industry.
   The idea is that every business model has a set of explicit and implicit
   assumptions based on which the model is constructed. These assumptions
   often have to do with consumer preferences for various product/service
   attributes, the demand for the product/service at any given price, the
   nature of the value chain from production to the ultimate distribution
   of the product/service to the consumer, and so on. Often, these
   assumptions are supported by experience or historical data. The key to
   innovation is to identify which of these assumptions can be discarded or
   replaced with new assumptions, so that a novel business model emerges,
   and this model leads to spectacular new growth. This chapter discusses
   how an organization can systematically approach innovation this way and
   provides numerous examples of instances in which this approach has been
   successfully implemented.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Pages = {{349-370}},
Abstract = {{Globally, the telecommunications industry is transitioning from a
   business model that relied heavily on voice communication as the primary
   source of income to one in which data services provide the largest share
   of revenues. This trend is evident in Europe, the United States, India,
   and several other countries. However, while data services have been
   introduced widely, not all countries have experienced the same level of
   success. In this chapter, we posit that the differences in economic
   benefit are directly related to the cultural uniqueness of each mobile
   market and recommend a consumer-centric approach as a potential solution
   to successful market uptake. Cultural uniqueness is evident in the
   consumption of high levels of multimedia content in South Korea which is
   not enjoyed in other economies despite the push by telecommunication
   providers. It is also evident in the success of mobile banking for the
   unbanked poor in parts of Africa but western societies have not
   exploited its potential. In this research, we used Anckar and D'Incau's
   (2002) analytical framework to assess consumer value-added preference
   structures by exploring the market preferences of a developing country
   which exhibits the characteristics of a telecommunication market that is
   saturated and poised for data services integration. The findings suggest
   that all value-added characteristics evaluated had a positive impact on
   consumer desirability for a mobile application. Most importantly, the
   findings highlighted that the inclusion of value-added features within a
   mobile application is not enough but optimizing the desired combination
   for a user group may be critical.}},

   and legal system which influences the operation of logistics ventures in
   Greece and a presentation of the funding possibilities according to
   Greek law. An economical sustainability study is being conducted
   according to the Net Present Value method (NPV), and two types of
   ventures are studied: an asset based venture, and a non asset based
   venture. At the end of this chapter, there is a sensitivity analysis
   with respect to the discount rate that is used in the NPV (Net Present
   Value) method. The results of this analysis showed that a change of the
   discount rate has significant consequences on the economics of the

   the central theme in the global business arena. The reality of rising
   energy cost and their impact on international affairs coupled with the
   different kinds of environmental issues has shifted the social and

   computing equipment is a low-risk way of doing business. It not only
   helps the environment but also reduce costs. It is also one of the
   largest growing trends in business today. Hence, the business community
   is now in search of an eco-friendly business model. This chapter
   highlights the concept of green computing, green business, and their
   needs in the current global scenario.}},

Abstract = {{In all major industrialized countries, the service sector is the largest
   economic segment maintaining the highest growth rate. A current trend in
   the Internet of Services is to develop and offer software as a service
   (SaaS). Some research activities, such as Theseus/TEXO
   (http://theseus-programm.de/en/914. php), focus on the design and
   development of Web-based service ecosystems based on Web-platforms which
   allow offering, trading, and executing of services over the Internet.
   This paper is based on the Integrated Service Engineering (ISE)
   methodology, an interdisciplinary methodology for developing electronic
   services. The focus of this work is laid on the development of business
   models from a strategic-/market-oriented perspective, prior to consider
   the service business processes and the underlying IT-oriented service
   concept. The role of the business strategist and its objectives is
   introduced. The methodology has been developed in the Theseus/TEXO
   project which is funded by the German Federal Ministry of Economy and
   Technology.}},

Abstract = {{Banking and investment services (BIS) firms provide retail, commercial,
   wholesale and investment services. The target audience of our BIS
   research includes CEOs, CIOs, CTOs, CFOs, chief risk officers, IT
   project leaders, architects and heads of business units. We expect to
   see focus on the following areas in 2011-2012: (i) Increased
   personalization for products, services and delivery models, (ii) More
   proactive risk management that propels business performance or
   differentiation, (iii) Improved financial services accessibility and new
   market and customer segment penetration into unbanked populations and
   the mass-affluent sectors, regionally, and into emerging markets.
   Continued focus on cost/income ratios; in particular, reducing
   fixed-cost pressures through consideration of newer delivery and
   sourcing models such as cloud (iv) business model re-engineering to
   ensure adequate capital and liquidity at acceptable performance levels
   (v) Greater attention to the collective, especially social networks,
   (vi) Better IT management capabilities to mare adequately address
   volatile business conditions while addressing governance requirements
   and resource competencies, (vii) Creating new partnerships with
   nontraditional providers to accelerate the delivery of new products and

Abstract = {{The Application Service Provider (ASP) concept is extended from
   traditional information application outsourcing as currently used by
   numerous industries for information applications. Although value-added
   service can be generated with ASPs, it can still have a high failure
   rate in ASP markets. This research applies Resource Based Theory (RBT)
   to evaluate the business models of ASPs in order to assess their
   positions and provide suggestions for development directions. Top ten
   application service providers among the fifty most significant ASPs were
   selected to investigate the global markets of the ASP industry and the
   trend of services beforehand Then three of them were explored to
   illustrate the RBT review. Based on the market review and the empirical
   investigation, it was found that only a few ASPs can provide integrated
   service contents which can adapt to fit the real demands of customers.
   ASPs should focus on the perspective of the ecosystem and consider
   employing strategic alliances in order to provide an integrated solution
   for their customers and sustain competitive advantage.}},

Abstract = {{At least when it comes to the German market we argue that the ``crisis
   rhetoric{''} about newspapers is highly questionable. The traditional
   financing model for journalistic content, enhanced by new but related
   businesses, still enables a return on sales well into double-digit
   figures as it is the case in well managed newspaper publishing houses.
   The model does indeed require a critical discussion on journalistic and
   publishing optimization in terms of strategic perspective. In this
   context we discuss ten issues which should be approached to optimize the
   newspaper business. Alternative financing models like non-profit
   organizations and cooperatives on the other hand are seen with
   scepticism. They especially bear dangers concerning the professional
   governance of publishing houses and the preservation of editorial
   independence.}},

Abstract = {{In theory, there is huge potential for reducing the energy used by
   existing single-family houses by thoroughly renovating them. For the
   successful market development of highly energy-efficient integrated
   renovations, supply chain collaboration is very important, while at the
   same time customer demand for integrated renovations has to be
   stimulated. A research and networking methodology was developed within
   the framework of the One Stop Shop project to identify and develop
   collaboration opportunities for advanced housing renovation in Belgium,
   Denmark, Finland and Norway. The research identified key supply-side
   needs through interviews and questionnaires, and analysed important
   elements for the development of a web-based portal that can connect
   supply and demand. The project further developed ideas and methods for
   collaboration and business model generation between different players on
   the renovation market. These different research results contributed to
   defining new business opportunities related to process innovation to
   unburden the homeowner and to achieve less fragmented renovation
   processes.}},

Abstract = {{With the emergence of Web 2.0, new online trends and technologies will
   continually emerge and play an increasingly important role in the way
   businesses operate. As Web 2.0 has revolutionised the internet by
   shifting from a published web to a user centric, user-generated web,
   businesses needed to understand how to change and adapt in order to
   benefit from these changes. This paper analyses organisations across a
   variety of industries, in order to determine how Web 2.0 is influencing
   the way companies conduct business - how they benefit, and what the
   advantages and disadvantages are. The authors will try to determine
   whether the traditional business models are changing or simply evolving
   through the utilisation of Web 2.0 technologies. This research
   contributes to the body of knowledge regarding the use of social media
   in commercial organisations.}},

Abstract = {{Despite its success in creating a strong market for its product and
   growing its customer base, PICS is going through a restructuring phase
   to overcome a variety of operational and financial challenges. This case
   study examines the concept of value-based management (VBM) and how
   applying it to the company's restructuring process would help PICS'S
   management track its performance and make sound strategic decisions for
   the company. The protagonist is PICS CEO Mr. Paul Antaki, who is being
   presented with a proposal from `Val-U' consultants on how VBM would
   create value for all PICS stakeholders.
   The case follows through the history of PICS, presenting the business
   model and the market for its products. It then moves on to outline the
   financial position of PICS over the period 2002-2005, which shows that,
   despite double-digit growth in revenue, the company has suffered from
   poor bottom lines that have put the company in severe financial
   distress.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - This present study attempted to examine the difference between
   brand-name and bandit technology companies in terms of operating models.
   Furthermore, the paper aimed to investigate the origin and developmental
   model of bandit.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study compared the open innovation
   approach against a closed one from the perspective of competitive
   strategies. This study used the content analysis and qualitative system
   dynamics (QSD) approach to explore the competitive strategies and
   inhibitory factors of bandit business model, and subsequently presents a
   causal-effect loop of business operations development in different
   stages.
   Findings - Bandit business model could be divided into three stages,
   according to the business operations development, namely ``growth,
   inhibition, and re-growth{''}. It often faces obstacles, when a bandit
   business expands to a certain level, stemming from the consequently
   disadvantageous conditions which limit the enterprise development. A
   bandit business will not remove such obstacles unless it reinforces its
   impregnable core values.
   Originality/value - This study contributed the attempt to use the
   qualitative system dynamics (QSD) approach to explore the competitive
   strategies and inhibitory factors of emerging business model as
   ``bandit{''}. As bandit products generate high utility for consumers and
   easily penetrate a demand-driven market, the Chinese bandit economic
   behavior (including copycat business practices) omnipresent in the
   economic market has triggered a controversy across the society. The
   findings in bandit business model uncovered the reasons that encourage
   the founding of small-sized start-up firms by practitioners, and showed
   the unseen path for business and innovation model research in the
   future.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the topic of the
   Chinese business model and provide a brief introduction to the papers in
   this special issue.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper explores the importance of
   studying business model in the Chinese market and summarises the eight
   papers in this issue.
   Findings - The papers in this special issue address what the business
   model is in China, how it influences organizational outcomes, and how to
   build the business model in the Chinese market. These papers may be
   germane to both researchers and practitioners concerned with managing
   business model in China. For scholars, these papers broaden the
   understanding of business model and extend the theoretical boundaries of
   the business model from the Western to the Eastern context. For
   practitioners doing business in China, these papers give implications on
   how to build business models in China as well as what institutional and
   technological factors should be considered when designing their business
   models.
   Research limitations/implications - Further investigation is needed into
   the interaction among Chinese firms' activities on business model design
   and operation and the institutional, technological, and market
   environment.
   Originality/value - Overall, these papers make remarkable contributions
   to our understanding of Chinese business model. The topics of these
   studies are various and the methods are also multiplex. Several
   interesting Chinese business models are addressed such as Bandit
   business model and ``a company + farmers{''}.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this study is to investigate how social media
   features enable crowdsourcing and to gain rich understanding of
   mechanisms that lead from online community design practices to success
   in crowdsourcing initiatives.
   Methodology/approach - Inductive qualitative methods were used for
   investigating the case of crowdsourcing-based microstock business model.
   Twenty-three in-depth interviews with stock photography industry
   insiders were combined with netnography data and documents.
   Findings - Two mechanisms influencing participants' motivation and
   peer-to-peer learning were identified. Both extrinsic and intrinsic
   motivations are important for participants' engagement.
   Research limitations/implications - Findings of this inductive effort
   should be replicated in other industry settings and used to develop
   testable propositions of antecedents and outcomes of crowdsourcing
   implementations.
   Practical implications - Companies embarking on crowdsourcing
   initiatives can enhance participants' motivations through social media
   and enable learning through online communities. Managers must understand
   who participates in the crowd and what their motivation is.
   Originality/value - This study is investigating under-researched
   peer-vetted creative production crowdsourcing model. Managers can use
   presented ideas for developing crowdsourcing online communities.}},

Abstract = {{Worldwide economic uncertainty has put the sustainability of the live
   and performing arts into question. Furthermore, due to technological
   changes, theatres must cope with audiences that access nearly all forms
   of entertainment using a single device, switch gears rapidly, and expect
   entertainment venues to share and achieve their aims. In response to
   these challenges, the authors offer a new business model and aesthetic
   of artistic convergence. In this concept, the distinctions between the
   performing, visual and media arts are broken down and theatres produce
   one play for distribution across different artistic mediums and
   channels. To support their proposal, the authors look to the past and
   demonstrate how the business philosophy and model employed by the
   early-20th-century movie and theatrical innovators Balaban and Katz are
   relevant and applicable today.}},

Abstract = {{Fuel cycles have not historically been integrated with repository
   design. Four alternative combinations of fuel cycles and repository
   systems are assessed in the present work: (a) traditional repositories,
   (b) repositories with spent nuclear fuel retrievability for recycle or
   as insurance against unforeseen repository failure, (c) colocation and
   integration of reprocessing and repositories, and (d) colocated
   specialized disposal facilities such as boreholes for different wastes.
   System design choices have major impacts on fuel cycle economics,
   accident risk, repository performance, nonproliferation, and repository
   siting. Consequently, there are large incentives to understand the
   different ways to couple fuel cycles and repositories. The evidence
   suggests that a repository as only a disposal site (the current system)
   is the least desirable option given current requirements for the United
   States. There are large incentives to develop repository sites that
   colocate and integrate all back-end fuel cycle facilities with the
   repository-independent of the fuel cycles that are ultimately chosen or
   how these fuel cycles evolve over time. Colocation and integration
   change the interface requirements between facilities by eliminating many
   storage and transport requirements such as the need for waste forms with
   high waste loadings. That, in turn, can result in reductions in cost,
   reductions in risk, and improved repository performance. For closed fuel
   cycles, colocation and integration may eliminate repository safeguards.
   This also suggests a repository business model similar to that of many
   airport authorities. Airport authorities manage the runways with
   colocated public and private airline terminals, aircraft maintenance
   bases, and related operations-all enabled and benefiting from the
   high-value runway asset. The common high-value back-end fuel cycle asset
   is the repository. For the local community and state government, such a
   strategy couples back-end fuel cycle benefits (high-technology jobs, tax
   revenue, etc.) with the repository site.}},

Abstract = {{Despite of growing oncology pipeline, cancer vaccines contribute only to
   a minor share of total oncology-attributed revenues. This is mainly
   because of a limited number of approved products and limited sales from
   products approved under compassionate or via early access entry in
   smaller and less developed markets. However revenue contribution from
   these products is extremely limited and it remains to be established
   whether developers are breaking even or achieving profitability with
   existing sales. Cancer vaccine field is well recognized for high
   development costs and risks, low historical rates of investment return
   and high probability of failures arising in ventures, partnerships and
   alliances. The cost of reimbursement for new oncology agents is not
   universally acceptable to payers limiting the potential for a global
   expansion, market access and reducing probability of commercial success.
   In addition, the innovation in cancer immunotherapy is currently focused
   in small and mid-size biotech companies and academic institutions
   struggling for investment. Existing R\&D innovation models are deemed
   unsustainable in current ``value-for-money{''} oriented healthcare
   environment. New business models should be much more open to
   collaborative, networked and federated styles, which could help to
   outreach global, markets and increase cost-efficiencies across an entire
   value chain. Lessons learned from some developing countries and
   especially from South Korea illustrate that further growth of cancer
   vaccine industry will depends not only on new business models but also
   will heavily rely on regional support and initiatives from different
   bodies, such as governments, payers and regulatory bodies.}},

Abstract = {{Security management in information societies is becoming extremely
   challenging where the resources are open and ubiquitous. The policies of
   the classified object change with its usage depending on the environment
   and its internal states. A classified object will have many
   stakeholders, with varying number of rights over it, all along its life.
   The relationship of stakeholders with objects is of our prime interest,
   where the object will be derived and/or distributed in its original
   form. In this contribution, we have classified stakeholders and objects,
   while concentrating on the specification for objects' usage at the
   stakeholder end. This will allow us to deploy our tools in an emulated
   environment, where these high level specifications will transform, to
   platform independent administrative policies and administer the
   emulation in a dynamic manner. This work will further lead us to
   investigate and provide tooling support for more granular semantically
   integrated control for stakeholders on their objects in a ubiquitous
   environment. We have concentrated on resources focusing the mobile
   platforms, taking Android as our case study. We base our work on top of
   recognized standards like that provided by Trusted Computing Group's
   Mobile Phone Working Group. It allows us to use the strong service
   oriented business model available in information based societies.}},

Abstract = {{Engagement with sustainability can be viewed as a process in which
   initiatives involving management, employees, stakeholders, and the
   community gradually facilitate changes in direction and attitude that
   are in line with sustainability principles. This view holds that an
   organization's culture is a key point of leverage in any attempt to move
   to a business model more closely aligned with sustainability concepts.
   With this in mind, an approach was developed to analyze business
   decisions in order to assess the sustainability culture of a water
   utility. This article presents an overview of this research, including
   background on how an organization's culture can influence decisions. The
   methodology for analyzing decision making from a sustainability policy
   perspective is demonstrated using a case study undertaken with an
   Australian public water utility.}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally, Internet has offered multimedia services independently of
   the services offered by companies associated to Telco (companies that
   traditionally offer telephony and associated services). In the last
   years, the technical community has assumed that the convergence of both
   worlds is a fact; however, there are many barriers to be removed. On one
   hand the emergence of cloud computing technologies will change the way
   of providing multimedia services. On the other hand economic issues are
   very important in this convergence process. In this chapter we describe
   how multimedia services are offered from Internet and the Telco. The
   convergence of Web 2.0 and Internet Protocol Multimedia Subsystem on the
   WIMS 2.0 initiative focuses on creating value for Internet and Telco and
   making multimedia services a reality for end users, independent of the
   underlying environment. We propose a novel strategy that uses cloud
   computing to facilitate the development and deployment of converged
   multimedia services. We also observe a sustainable business model
   accompanying the converged proposals to offer innovative multimedia
   services.}},

Abstract = {{In the current era of the innovation economy, online trading or
   exchanging knowledge can introduce creativity and new technologies,
   thereby lowering innovation costs and expediting R\&D of knowledge
   creation and product. However, descriptions of knowledge products are
   often more complex and abstract than those of physical products. To
   design a function-completed knowledge trading platform and to enable
   accurate searches for required knowledge on the platform even with
   unclear or ambiguous descriptions, knowledge and requirement
   representation structure models are needed by sellers to clearly
   describe knowledge features and by buyers to identify required
   knowledge. This study applied the knowledge-commercialised business
   model in the design of a functional framework for an online knowledge
   trading platform. The proposed similarity measurement algorithm for
   realising online knowledge trading enables precise searches of knowledge
   based on abstract requirement descriptions. The algorithm comprises one
   direct and seven indirect similarity computing functions based on
   different relationships between abstract concepts in both knowledge and
   requirement representation structure models. The framework and knowledge
   similarity measurement proposed in this study can be used to implement
   functionally complete k-commerce websites and to match knowledge
   requesters with providers.}},

Abstract = {{In 2003, the Minnesota Department of Transportation (DOT) developed a
   unique method of integrating context-sensitive solutions (CSS) into its
   design-build program in a process called visual quality management.
   Although this name implied that the process was only concerned with
   generating an aesthetically appealing project, the process was not as
   concerned with visual quality per se as it was with a method that
   resulted in a project that was acceptable to the public. This method was
   based on the CSS principles and practices that the Minnesota DOT had
   adopted as a business model, notably the inclusion of stake-holders; the
   use of interdisciplinary design teams; the adoption of multimodal
   solutions; the solving of associated social, economic, and environmental
   problems; and the creation of a safe, efficient, and effective
   transportation system. Visual quality management was actually a method
   for measuring conformance with a project's visual quality goals, which
   had been generated according to the principles of CSS. This process
   required the successful bidder to develop a visual quality management
   plan that outlined how the contractor would define and mitigate visual
   impacts, the responsibilities and authority of a visual quality manager
   and a visual quality review committee, and the process that the
   contractor would use to engage that committee in developing a visual
   quality manual. The manual established the criteria for developing CSS
   for 15 design elements that constituted a transportation project's
   visual environment and to which the contractor had to conform.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter provides a framework to analyse the marketing and promotion
   advantages of Virtual Communities. Virtual Communities offer companies
   the possibility to carry out a new products and services promotion and
   to develop trustful relationships with customers. The key element in the
   use of Virtual Communities for these purposes is the wide amount of
   customers that can be reached. Virtual Communities present the aptitude
   to generate social influence and knowledge sharing among customers. As a
   consequence, it brings out the increasing number of skills, competencies
   and ``knowledge profiles{''} of each customer involved in the virtual
   environment. The framework is consequently applied to Second Life in
   order to analyse three different business strategies that companies
   usually implement by using this platform. The first strategy allows
   companies to perform the placement of their products/services in a
   dynamic form. The second strategy provides companies the possibility to
   have a better knowledge of customers' needs in order to develop products
   and services that satisfy customer's expectations. Finally, the third
   strategy allows companies to develop high brand awareness.}},

Abstract = {{Basel III - the new prudential framework for banks - is the Basel
   Committee on Banking Supervision response to the causes and consequences
   of the global financial crisis. Its main objectives are to improve the
   financial stability of the banking sector and to minimize the
   probability of recurrence of another crisis of such magnitude. The new
   regulations 177 will have a considerable impact on both the individual
   banks and the financial system considering the stronger global capital
   and liquidity rules and the macro prudential overlay which is addressing
   issues regarding the systemic risk. This paper attempts to summarize the
   key changes introduced by Basel III and to explore its implication on
   the banking sector and the economy. Basel III requirements will have a
   substantial impact on capital and funding which will imply a decrease of
   the profitability of the banking industry. The Romanian banking system
   will be however less affected as all the banks which operate on the
   Romanian market already met the new requisites. Considering the
   important role of the banking sector in the economy, the Basel III rules
   will also have an impact on the real economy through the decrease of GDP
   among other effects. The paper also explores some practical actions for
   banks to take in order to partially mitigate the Basel III impact on
   their profitability and activity. The restructuring of the balance
   sheet, an adjustment of the business model as well as implementing new
   capital and liquidity strategies should be considered by banks in order
   to establish an effective and efficient implementation.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing is the new consolidated trend in ICT, often considered
   as the panacea to all the problems of existing large-scale distributed
   paradigms such as Grid and hierarchical clustering. The Cloud
   breakthrough is the service oriented perspective of providing everything
   ``as a service{''}. Different from the others large-scale distributed
   paradigms, it was born from commercial contexts, with the aim of selling
   the temporarily unexploited computing resources of huge datacenters in
   order to reduce the costs. Since this business model is really
   attractive and convenient for both providers and consumers, the Cloud
   paradigm is quickly growing and widely spreading, even in non commercial
   context. In fact, several activities on the Cloud, such as Nimbus,
   Eucalyptus, OpenNEbula, and Reservoir, etc., have been undertaken,
   aiming at specifying open Cloud infrastructure middleware.}},

Abstract = {{Health information systems have the potential to improve healthcare
   quality. Accordingly, German health authorities are currently building a
   nationwide telematics infrastructure (TI) to connect care providers'
   information systems via a common network. Telemedicine services based on
   this TI will offer communication cooperation documentation and analysis
   features such as web services to ensure pervasive availability and
   integrity of medical data in the German public health system. Fields of
   applications involve pharmaceutical drug safety, insurance data
   maintenance, electronic healthcare records (EHR) and emergency records.
   These services are specified by the German public health authorities for
   all caregivers. Value added applications that use the infrastructure and
   its services to support treatment and administration, can be deployed by
   software vendors thus supplying innovative services in the field of
   e-health.
   In order to enable a vital competition for value adding services, it is
   essential to provide sustainable business models for medical service
   providers to foster development and adoption of innovations deployed via
   the TI. This chapter uses a case study to illustrate the situation of a
   services provider that wants to offer a solution for telemonitoring via
   the TI. The analysis of the current state of the German public health
   system and the TI reveals several barriers hindering the progress of the
   proposed system. Pointing out critical issues for the development of
   sustainable e-health solutions, the work elaborates key success factors
   of past e-health projects. The most significant findings, such as
   privacy, controlling structures and incentive mechanisms, are addressed
   and analyzed in depth. A corresponding business model for the service
   provider is developed, using an integrative business model approach to
   address external factors, such as legal conditions, competitors and
   strategy development. The result is an actor, revenue and services model
   for the provider of the telemonitoring solutions.
   For verification of the revenue model, the article uses the e3 value
   methodology to assess the financial profitability of the approach. The
   discussion includes the adjustment of financial incentives for the
   developers of sustainable e-health innovations that boost the
   improvement of information technology utilization in healthcare.}},

Abstract = {{How do websites earn revenue? Many websites enter this field with a
   so-called ``bright perspective,{''} then end up adding their name to the
   dotcom failure statistics.
   In today's online marketing arena, there are remarkable concepts which
   are rarely available for public study and consideration. For instance,
   the e-business models are considered trendy by many Internet specialists
   who do not consider superior operational efficiency as a critical factor
   for success in companies such as Cisco, EBay, Dell, and Amazon. However,
   they believe that the business model or method adopted in modern
   technology is the basis for their success. With the implicit awareness
   of success in these kinds of companies, few of them have explicit
   insight regarding this success; therefore, they cannot distinguish the
   different kinds of businesses and business models utilized by giant
   merchants. Thus, this chapter introduces e-business and draws a line
   between e-business and e-commerce. Also, different kinds of e-business
   models are examined because an advertiser should know the business
   models of the websites which may be publishing his advertising. Above
   all, at the end of this chapter, the reader will be able to distinguish
   between the businesses and business models of commercial and
   non-commercial websites and understand their earning methods.}},

Abstract = {{The business model for U.S. telephony has undergone not one but a
   complex series of disruptions in the past 15 years. Technological
   innovation was certainly a factor, but demographics, regulation, and
   organizational dynamics both inside and around the carriers also played
   their parts in the drama. With anything so vast, old, and
   technologically complex, it is impossible to summarize without losing
   important facets that often are the subject of book-length monographs in
   and of themselves. One example was the carriers' yellow-pages publishing
   business. In many ways the forerunner to Google, commercial telephone
   directories were a \$14 billion business in 1995, bigger than the entire
   recording industry. Furthermore, unlike newspapers (roughly \$50 billion
   in 2000) or music, the telecommunications sector is a sprawling,
   regulated, but rapidly evolving complex that is particularly difficult
   to change. In addition to being complicated, telecommunications
   companies are big, representing about 3\% of the global economy.}},

Abstract = {{The business model disruption framework as it applies to music has
   multiple moving pieces: Tastes change, attitudes toward intellectual
   property sharing differ significantly by demographic, and the place of
   recorded music in modern life is also in a period of deep transition.
   The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), which began as a
   standards body, became perhaps the most disliked lobbying group in the
   country by suing music lovers, which was a curious strategy, to put it
   charitably. Music is a small but visible industry (moving and storage
   was about the same size, but Mayflower never had the Grammy Awards), and
   it was also disrupted early in the Internet's life cycle, before telecom
   or newspapers, for instance. How did technology-related events and
   trends disrupt the music industry's business model to such an extent
   that its trade association felt compelled to adopt such an extreme
   position?}},

Abstract = {{In this chapter, the author takes a look at how organizations can
   integrate Social Media technology into their current electronic commerce
   environment. While electronic commerce technology has been around for
   many years, social media technology is emerging as the dominating force
   in commerce itself. Organizations must evolve their online environments
   in order to progress to the next level of service delivery. Social Media
   provides the basic technology for creating a network of customers who
   are passionate about the company's product offering. The key here is the
   commitment of the customers throughout the business lifecycle. Social
   Media includes a variety of technologies and concepts such as social
   networking, weblogs, wikis, Really Simple Syndication (RSS), social
   tagging, mashups, information markets, and user defined content. This
   chapter will review several different examples where organizations have
   added Social Media to their environment and impact that integration is
   having to the entire business model.}},

Abstract = {{The idea behind cloud computing is to deliver Infrastructure-, Platform-
   and Software-as-a-Service (IaaS, PaaS and SaaS) over the Internet on an
   easy payper-use business model. However, current offerings from cloud
   providers are based on proprietary technologies. As a consequence,
   consumers run into a risk of a vendor lock-in with little flexibility in
   moving their services to other providers. This can hinder the
   advancement of cloud computing to small- and medium-sized enterprises.
   In this chapter, we present our work in outlining the motivations and
   current trends of achieving interoperability, especially in the area of
   IaaS. More specifically, this work delivers a comprehensive taxonomy as
   a guideline for cloud providers to enable interoperability within their
   cloud infrastructures. Thus, this taxonomy discusses important topics of
   IaaS, such as access mechanism, virtual appliance, security, and
   service-level agreement.}},

Title = {{FUTURE DIRECTION OF SUSTAINABLE BUILDINGS IN JAPAN}},
Journal = {{OPEN HOUSE INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{5-19}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Amidst growing concern about the sustainability of human society,
   architecture studies are focusing increasingly on the means to achieve
   sustainable buildings. While various forward-looking studies are ongoing
   in this field, it is also important to realize that critical lessons may
   be learned from historical buildings that have withstood the test of
   time. Many traditional wooden buildings in Japan provide excellent
   examples of sustainable building design and production practices that
   are inherently flexible and therefore highly resistant to obsolescence.
   This paper first summarizes a recent lecture by Utida outlining his
   research into the flexibility and durability of modern buildings, which
   is based on comparisons with Japan's traditional wooden buildings.
   It is based on the results of Open Building researches in Japan,
   especially works in Utida laboratory of Tokyo University (1970-1986) and
   in All Open Building Sub Committee. This is followed by an overview of
   the flexibility and material/social lifespan of buildings, and of the
   developmental trends seen in builders' organizations. And lastly, the
   future direction of the Japanese detached housing industry is explored.
   Specifically, the paper traces the changes in the Japanese detached
   housing industry between 1970 and 2070, and shows how the industry has
   been shifting toward a sustainable business model. Problems arising from
   these changes and possible solutions are discussed with concrete
   examples, and one specific business model is singled out and defined as
   a promising solution.}},

Abstract = {{In solving traditional public sector ``government failures{''} and
   social problems not addressed by public charities, social enterprises
   trigger the imitation of enterprise management by non-profit
   organizations, thus displaying a trend of commercial development in the
   development of economic value and public welfare value. However, because
   of social and cultural background differences, European countries and
   the United States have had different backgrounds of social enterprise
   development. Taiwan has had experience of social enterprise development
   similar to that of Western countries. Beginning with the establishment
   of philosophy, motivation, organizational life cycle, development
   characteristics of various stages, and foundation of operating business
   model, the organizational development of social enterprises in Taiwan
   region began primarily with social welfare and charity foundations,
   while the establishment of religious organizations further played the
   role of an important driving force. Thus, social enterprises began
   gradually moving towards association models formed by disadvantaged
   groups and cooperatives of community development. In recent years,
   social enterprise development has combined popularization of social
   capital and has transitioned into company models.}},

Abstract = {{Field-based medical programs are common adjuncts to development,
   headquarters medical, and commercial operations for most pharmaceutical
   companies in the United States. The shift in regulatory complexity,
   coupled with a waning acceptance and impact of the traditional
   ``reach/frequency{''} business model observed by many pharmaceutical
   companies, has enhanced the strategic importance of field-based medical
   groups. Lack of standardized training and assessment of functional
   capabilities may threaten this enhanced role and raise the question of
   the need for a uniform certification process. To confirm or dispel our
   own bias about the need for certification, we explored this issue using
   an informal web-based survey tool. A simple majority (63\%) of
   responders to our survey felt certification was not needed. It was
   interesting that the subset of managers was evenly split, while the
   majority (70\%) of individual contributors was not supportive of a
   certification requirement. These results suggest that while
   certification is not an attractive option to the majority of responders,
   a meaningful minority of responders, including some managers of medical
   science liaison programs, believe certification is important. Our
   opinion is that while the move to certification is not imminent, this
   will continue to be an important topic for discussion and debate in the
   years to come.}},

Abstract = {{In cloud computing, a cloud user pays proportionally to the amount of
   the consumed resources (bandwidth, memory, and CPU cycles etc.). We
   posit that such a cloud computing system is vulnerable to DDoS
   (Distributed Denial-of-Service) attacks against quota. Attackers can
   force a cloud user to pay more and more money by exhausting its quota
   without crippling its execution system or congesting links. In this
   paper, we address this issue and claim that cloud should enable users to
   pay only for their admitted traffic. We design and prototype such a
   charging model in a Core Lab testbed infrastructure and show an example
   application.}},

Abstract = {{Today's uncertain economic conditions are forcing companies to change
   the way they do business. A significant change is the increasing use of
   cloud computing. Moreover, applications have become consumer products
   thanks to the rapid consumer adoption of portable terminals typified by
   the smartphone. In line with these trends, Fujitsu's ``INTARFRM{''}
   application framework, which currently contributes to the development of
   medium- to large-scale information and communications technology (ICT)
   enterprise systems, is well positioned for contributing to the efforts
   of ``individual developers.{''} Fujitsu has developed a plan for
   targeting INTARFRM at individual software developers, such as computer
   science students and freelance software developers, and for providing a
   service that combines a customized version of INTARFRM for such users
   with an Internet-accessible cloud-type development center. Furthermore,
   by adding new service concepts not found in existing system integration
   (SI) business practices to this ``contribution plan,{''} Fujitsu can
   develop a new INTARFRM business model that provides benefits for the
   user and differentiates Fujitsu from its competitors.}},

   The paper argues that this inversion is likely to reduce the overall

   consumers can be charged non-transaction related fees, and discourage
   the entry of new payment systems.}},

Title = {{STABILITY AND COMPETITION IN EU BANKING DURING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS: THE
   ROLE OF STATE AID CONTROL}},
Journal = {{COMPETITION POLICY INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{8-21}},
Month = {{FAL}},
Abstract = {{The available evidence suggests that the European Commission's State Aid
   ({''}SA{''}) control of public assistance to the financial sector in the
   European Union during the period 2008-2010 has had a positive impact on
   both financial stability and competition in the EU's internal banking
   market. The particular features of the crisis regime dedicated to
   assessing State Aid not only allowed the disbursement of unprecedented
   amounts of aid, often in record time, but also rendered the aid more
   effective by ensuring that aid recipients, where necessary, were
   restructured or liquidated. The conditions imposed on banks receiving
   large amounts of aid have generally led to highly significant
   restructuring and addressed fundamental weaknesses in business models,
   helping to avoid the creation of ``zombie banks.{''} At the same time,
   where aid amounts were relatively small and banks were sound, these
   rules allowed financial institutions to be aided without requiring
   changes in their business model.
   SA control has ensured that the large amounts of aid granted did not
   lead to major distortions in the Internal Market. Absent this control,
   these public interventions could have triggered a fragmentation of the
   Internal Market itself.
   While all substantial aid is likely to have a distortive effect,
   available indicators suggest that SA control has effectively mitigated
   these consequences. There is little evidence of retrenchment behind
   national borders and aided banks have generally not seen their market
   shares increase. Moreover, the crisis framework is likely to have had a
   strong signalling function to financial institutions with respect to
   moral hazard going forward.
   In the absence of EU-wide rules for bank resolution, the SA crisis
   regime also presently acts as the de facto EU-wide resolution framework.
   However, it is an imperfect tool resolution compared to a full-fledged
   regulatory framework that helps avoid recourse to aid in the first
   instance and can provide clear ex ante guidance for all market players
   (which in itself is confidence-enhancing).
   The re-emergence of serious tensions in the EU banking sector from the
   summer of 2011 onwards is largely linked to concerns about the
   sustainability of public finances in a number of EU Member States
   feeding through to concerns about assets on banks' balance sheets. To
   remedy this, stability-oriented macroeconomic--especially
   fiscal-policies are required, and appropriate regulation of banking is
   needed. A key challenge for State Aid control in EU banking, therefore,
   is to ensure appropriate coordination with regulatory and macroeconomic
   policies as they are further developed.}},

   causes of suffering. He began looking for ways to harness the incredible
   power of business to make the world better.
   After running up against the complexities of the tax code regarding
   nonprofits, he decided to create a limited liability corporation called
   Omidyar Network, whose staff would be able to handle both nonprofit
   grants and for-profit investments. This hybrid philanthropic model faced
   cultural challenges, in part because a program officer's due diligence
   for a foundation is vastly different from an investment analyst's due
   diligence for a venture capital firm, and in part because it was
   difficult to incentivize the for-profit employees without
   disincentivizing the nonprofit ones.
   Eventually the organization was restructured to be more like a venture
   capital firm, though more than half of its \$442 million in commitments
   has gone to nonprofits, with a focus on microfinance. Omidyar believes
   that true philanthropists will use every tool they can to create impact,
   and business is a key part of the equation. HBR Reprint R1109A}},

Abstract = {{While most models of location decisions of firms are based on the
   principle of utility maximizing behavior, the present study assumes that
   location decisions are just part of business cycle models, in which
   location is considered along other business decisions. The business
   model results in a series of location requirements and these are matched
   against location characteristics. Given this theoretical perspective,
   the modeling challenge then becomes how to find the match between firm
   types and the set of location characteristics using observations of the
   spatial distribution of firms. In this paper, several Bayesian
   classifier networks are compared in terms of their performance, using a
   large data set collected for the Netherlands. Results demonstrate that
   by taking relationships between predictor variables into account the
   Bayesian classifiers can improve prediction accuracy compared to
   commonly used decision tree. From a substantive point of view, our
   results indicate that different sets of urban characteristics and
   accessibility requirements are relevant to different office types as
   reflected in the spatial distribution of these office firms. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{In recent years, there have been significant changes to the way
   audiences store and consume video content and how broadcasters
   successfully monetize that content. There have been successes and
   failures, but ultimately with each new advance in technology there has
   been a struggle between the content providers and the content consumers.
   Content providers, desperate to retain their ability to monetize
   expensive rights-based assets, are suspicious of new open platform
   technologies. Consumers are wary of closed technologies, having been
   hurt in the past by countless format wars and technology races. Looking
   to the music industry, we can see just how badly things can go wrong
   when the business model does not keep pace with advances in technology.
   This paper examines recent developments in disruptive cloud computing
   platform, including the foundation technologies that have made this
   possible, such as hypervisors, virtualization, hardware abstraction, and
   data center automation. From these foundation technologies, platforms
   such as Amazon's Elastic Computing Cloud (EC2), and Microsoft Azure have
   evolved; current status and likely future developments are examined.
   Building from this analysis, how current broadcast products that are
   already utilizing these cloud platforms in isolation is discussed. The
   way in which next-generation system integration, at the software level,
   can bring these products together into a coherent solution for
   broadcasters with the capability to reduce costs and improve
   time-to-market for new channels and services is also examined. The paper
   concludes with an assessment of the market opportunity for this new
   technology and an identification of current gap technologies and
   services in this new sector.}},

Abstract = {{Top Agro (TA - not its real name) is a small crop protection start-up
   operating in the European Union. In a relatively short period of time TA
   has been able to secure a reasonable profit margin and build a solid
   niche in the Italian crop protection market. The driving force in their
   success is the professional expertise of the two owners, their knowledge
   of the domestic market, and the highly flexible business model they've
   developed. Chemicals are sourced either in the Far East via a Hong Kong
   based commercial partner or purchased directly from other European
   domestic suppliers. TA is responsible for the formulation and packaging
   of the finished product, which is then distributed in the domestic
   Italian market. Although TA is now profitable, further sales growth is
   unlikely. One of the owners is convinced that significant benefits may
   be obtained by identifying and controlling the key risks that TA is
   exposed to, in particular by reducing the price risk in their
   international supply chain.
   This case has been classroom tested at the senior undergraduate and MBA
   level with good results. It works well as opening case for an eMBA
   course on managing price risk, as it provides an opportunity to map the
   risk ``opportunity set{''} via the ERM challenging students to reason
   and set intervention priorities by focusing on currency exchange rates
   and risk management as the most immediate and promising action.}},

Abstract = {{Because technology innovation has changed the way people do business
   significantly, adopting information technology (IT) for strategic
   planning has become a vital issue for today's business management.
   However, most studies seemed to focus more on technology than on
   information in IT. Unfortunately, the way technology alters the business
   model is not as much as the way information changes an organization's
   managerial concept. The impact is beyond marketing issues and is very
   important to an organization's managerial philosophy. This study adopts
   a strategy concept called the co-alignment principle (Olsen, West, \&
   Tse, 1998), to investigate how an information system (IS) could be
   designed to enhance and process the information flows involved in the
   processes of strategy formulation and implementation. It places IT
   implementation issues directly at the heart of strategic management for
   research. Using qualitative research approach with a single case-study
   method employed, 11 recommendations and 10 propositions were obtained to
   address and handle the newly discovered 7 key issues for strategy
   formulation and implementation. The study also exemplified that when
   these issues are being handled by an IS properly designed, a
   coordination strategic IT framework that goes beyond the thinking of
   cost saving and productivity increase is achieved as well.}},

Abstract = {{A great number of firms worldwide have invested a lot in the application
   of ERP systems to modify their business model and be able to offer
   better processes. When firms implement ERP systems they try to integrate
   and optimize their processes in what they consider their key areas. The
   present chapter tries to offer a view centered on the main reasons why
   Spanish firms have implemented ERP systems in the last ten years and
   what have been their main critical success factors and their main
   failure factors too. For that, the authors apply a model that they have
   previously developed based in 5 main groups of variables. The authors
   ask firms about their perceptions and final results provided by the
   variables affecting their change processes in the ERP implementation.
   The authors try to offer a realistic view of what has been taking place
   in the Spanish market.}},

Abstract = {{The strategy to improve business results through globalization has
   become increasingly common. Success in reaping the business value
   intended from a globalization strategy is, unfortunately, not as common.
   As national boundaries blur and everyone grows more connected through
   global collaboration, the dynamics of organizational life grow more
   complex. These complexities offer challenge, confusion, and frustration
   - but also great opportunity! The key to achieving improved business
   results does not hinge on strategies alone, but also on our ability to
   effectively lead global product and service development teams to
   successfully execute the strategies. Those struggling the most are the
   practitioners who find their historic team leadership practices
   ineffective in today's global business model. To effectively lead a
   global team, one must first understand the forces driving our companies
   to a global business model. This chapter focuses on the forces that fuel
   and constrain globalization.}},

Abstract = {{In the last ten years, the world has witnessed immense advances in media
   and Internet technologies. Through examination of the use of social
   media, virtual collaboration platforms, and live streamed access to
   images, graphics, and video, this chapter offers a new approach to
   education which calls for leaders to use technology to inform and
   connect teachers, students, and the community. Similar to the changes in
   the entertainment industry, educational institutions can adopt an
   interactive, collaborative, and socially aware model of knowledge
   creation to engage more students and encourage innovation in issues of
   global scope. The value of making this change is examined through
   curricula that stress multidisciplinary projects and provide hands on
   experiential learning. Lacking the market forces of the entertainment
   industry, being primarily supported by public funds, education
   institutions face more legal, political and business model barriers.
   However, the benefits of digital media so far outweigh the risks that
   the next decade will see the emergence of learning environments that
   provide as much of a quantum leap in pedagogy as did the advent of the
   printing press more than five hundred years ago. Examples of the
   emotional appeal of digital media combined with the relatively low cost
   of scaling with the Internet are provided as impetus to overcome
   resistance to change in creating new institutions of learning.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter aims to present a proposal for a model that supports
   organizational governance through the alignment of business with
   Information Technology - IT. Firstly, it was observed that there are
   some paradigms which limit the use of enterprise architectures and
   hinder governance functions. Secondly, it focuses on the IT unit, where
   IT systems and subsystems are interrelated and the performance levels of
   the organization are aggregated, creating a macro-structure system
   capable of supporting corporate governance and IT. Finally, the IBM's
   Component Business Model - CBM (R) was applied to represent
   relationships of the IT unit with the organization, through decomposing
   the organization into business components that supply and demand
   services to facilitate their governance and management.}},

Abstract = {{Despite its success in creating a strong market for its product and
   growing its customer base, PICS is going through a restructuring phase
   to overcome a variety of operational and financial challenges. This case
   study examines the concept of value-based management (VBM) and how
   applying it to the company's restructuring process would help PICS'S
   management track its performance and make sound strategic decisions for
   the company. The protagonist is PICS CEO Mr. Paul Antaki, who is being
   presented with a proposal from `Val-U' consultants on how VBM would
   create value for all PICS stakeholders.
   The case follows through the history of PICS, presenting the business
   model and the market for its products. It then moves on to outline the
   financial position of PICS over the period 2002-2005, which shows that,
   despite double-digit growth in revenue, the company has suffered from
   poor bottom lines that have put the company in severe financial
   distress.}},

Abstract = {{This work provides a framework for techno-business analysis of service
   platforms that can be used for evaluation of business models and
   strategic positions in collaborative service provision. It is based on
   the following modeling tools: techno-business model, generic service
   platform approximate, scenario modeling techniques, and service and
   enabler portfolio analysis. Our modeling approach is a synthesis of
   qualitative and quantitative analyses. We show that Markowitz' portfolio
   theory (financial risk-return analysis) can also be applied on service
   and on enablers portfolios if their specificity is realistically
   modeled. We demonstrate the most important modeling procedures
   theoretically and evaluate them practically on a chosen service delivery
   platform. Our research results and experiences show that service
   portfolio theory is very useful for evaluation of business strategies of
   different industrial actors, participating in collaborative service
   provision.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes business models and strategies that could succeed in
   North Korea, establishes seven North Korean business models combining
   four economic resource factors (labor, capital, technology/management
   know-how, and natural resources), and illustrates successful strategies
   by providing applicable cases for each model. In addition, the paper
   describes how the seven models could be applied to the existing four
   North Korean SEZs, suggesting recommended industries for each SEZ.
   Lastly, the paper suggests that the South Korean government should use
   its participation in the joint Korean SEZs (the Gaeseong and Mt. Kumgang
   SEZs) as a basis for a robust policy that would use the program as
   leverage for future unification.}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) have to interconnect
   with content providers to provide network services to customers. The
   current business model that connectivity and bandwidth become
   commodities has motivated ISPs to distribute content and other
   application-specific services directly to their customers. Hence, it is
   desirable for ISPs to economize existing infrastructure to support a
   variety of applications and services.
   We propose a dynamic mesh-based overlay peer-to-peer infrastructure
   (D-MORE) and illustrate its example usage case among other potentials.
   We describe several key techniques, namely capacity classification,
   locality-awareness and incentive mechanisms for construction of the
   tiered infrastructure. Through extensive simulations, we show D-MORE
   scales well with an increasing number of hosts, in terms of control
   overhead and link stress, for supporting media distribution services. We
   propose further improvements to enhance the D-MORE performance, which
   brings up to 35\% network resource savings and up to 200\% control
   overhead reduction in our simulations. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   paint overspray wastes from water systems known as detackification,
   represents an area of opportunity for the adoption of waste minimisation
   protocols. A new biotechnology approach to paint detackification is fast
   gaining acceptance in this application. This paper will review the use

Abstract = {{The success of companies such as Myspace and You Tube have focused

   model on participative media, leveraging a set of new social-based
   technologies, dubbed ``Web 2.0{''}. This article describes the quickly
   emerging social behavior of online user-generated video. Five clear
   findings stand out: a) Participative media is already widespread, even
   it is still biased socio-demographically in favor of young males; b)
   Participation is fostered mostly by the desire to fame, and to a lesser
   extent financial incentives; c) On top of those drivers, social network
   aspects stand as critical drivers of the growth of user-generated video;
   d) Online video users limit themselves to 2 to 3 sites; e) Users of
   online videos are keen to have a more comprehensive offering than UGC
   video alone- this includes conventional TV shows as well as premium
   content such as movies. Taking together, those findings lead to the
   conjecture that the market for online video will quickly evolve to a
   concentrated number of destination sites, aggregating all types of

Abstract = {{E-business can provide absolute earnings both in terms of productivity
   and efficiency. Therefore, companies tend to incorporate information
   technologies within their business strategies, and, particularly, within
   their logistic activities. The purpose of logistics is to create supply
   chains with lower costs. Reverse logistics involves the layout of a
   product from the consumption point to another point, in case of
   irregularity, in order to recover the remaining value or to dispose the
   product. E-business development involves the transformation of
   traditional logistics, through a flexible and structural approach,
   depending on business model, products and customer services. This paper
   aims to present a description of reverse logistics from an e-business
   approach and also the advantages and disadvantages of adopting this
   activity. In order to emphasize the importance of information
   technologies incorporation within reverse logistics deployment, we
   present an image of this activity both in e-business context and that of
   traditional forms.}},

Abstract = {{In the current competitive scenario, where business relationships are
   fundamental in building successful business models and inter/intra
   organizational business processes are progressively digitalized, an
   end-to-end methodology is required that is capable of guiding business
   networks through the Internetworked Enterprise (IE) paradigm: a new and
   innovative organizational model able to leverage Internet technologies
   to perform real-time coordination of intra and inter-firm activities, to
   create value by offering innovative and personalized products/services
   and reduce transaction costs. This chapter presents the TEKNE project
   Methodology of change that guides business networks, by means of a
   modular and flexible approach, towards the IE techno-organizational
   paradigm, taking into account the competitive environment of the network
   and how this environment influences its strategic, organizational and
   technological levels. Contingency, the business model, enterprise
   architecture and performance metrics are the key concepts that form the
   cornerstone of this methodological framework.}},

   response to the expansion of its client segments and a potential new
   approach to MRO operations based on advanced fleet management practices
   that would radically change the firm's organization and value network
   with respect to its MRO service offering, thereby yielding extensive

   theory in a nonmathematical approach to explaining the nature of the REM
   enterprise.
   Findings - The chapter seeks to establish the business model of the REM.
   By inquiring in to the nature of the REM enterprise, the chapter
   provides the basis for future research.
   Research Limitations - The research was limited in terms of potential
   case studies because this is a new business model that is being
   proposed.
   Practical Implications - The chapter could have large practical
   implications for increased and more consistent revenues to philanthropic
   organizations. Since writing the chapter, we tried to implement our own
   REM business model in an on campus coffee shop. Other ventures are being
   established in a similar vein.
   Value of the Chapter - The adoption of the L3C legal structure by a
   handful of states demonstrates the desire to establish new business
   models with charitable ends. Likewise, the REM business model hopes to
   increase levels of philanthropy while spurring innovative thought about
   the Independent Sector which has been under represented in economic
   research.}},

Abstract = {{World-wide roll out of Digital Cinema (D-Cinema) is pushing the
   boundaries for Ultra High Definition content to all of us - the users.
   This poses new challenges on assessing our perception of high quality
   media and also understanding how quality can impact the business model.
   We use Quality of Experience (QoE) as the term used to describe the
   perception of how usable or good the users think the media or services
   are. In order to understand QoE we explore the Human Visual System (HVS)
   and discuss the impact of HVS on designing a methodology for measuring
   subjective quality in D-Cinema as a use case. Following our methodology,
   we describe our laboratory set up at the NOVA kino a 440 seat fully
   digitized screen in full cinema production 24/7. This setup is used for
   subjective assessment of D-Cinema content, applying a test methodology
   adopted from existing recommendations. The subjective quality results
   are then used to design and to validate an objective metric. Our
   experiments demonstrate that traditional quality metrics cannot be
   adopted in D-Cinema presentations directly. Instead we propose a
   HVS-based approach to improve the performance of objective quality
   metrics, such as PSNR, SSIM, and PHVS, in quality assessment of D-Cinema
   setups. Finally we conclude by discussing how quality impacts the
   business model, using empirical data from a pilot D-Cinema roll out in
   Norway the NORDIC project. This pilot showed that quality can influence
   users and create more loyalty and willingness to pay a premium if the
   high quality is used to enhance their experience. Examples are the
   widespread reintroduction of 3D as well as alternative content such as
   music, sports, and business related presentations.}},

Abstract = {{Business process modeling (BPM) is gaining attention as a measure for
   analysis and improvement of the business process. BPM analyzes the
   Current business process as an As-Is model and solves problems to
   improve the current business, and also aims to create a business process
   that produces value as a To-Be model. However, research into techniques
   that connect the business process improvement acquired by BPM to the
   implementation of the information system seamlessly is rarely reported.
   If the business model obtained by BPM is converted to UML, and the
   implementation can be carried out by the technique of UML, one can
   expect an improvement in the efficiency of information system
   implementation. In this paper, we describe a method for system
   development that converts the process model obtained by BPM into UML.
   The method is evaluated by modeling a prototype of a parts procurement
   system. In the evaluation, a comparison with a case in which the system
   is implemented using the conventional UML techniques without BPM is
   performed. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Electr Eng Jpn, 169(4):

Abstract = {{By the end of 2008, companies based on the business model of offshore
   production were observed to be rethinking their business models, tending
   to consider the repatriation of production bases in order to lower costs
   and shorten delivery times. In this article, the authors of China's
   Electronics Industry (2009 Edition), M. Pecht and L. Zuga, (City
   University of Hong Kong Press, Hong Kong, China, 2009) argue that
   repatriation is not likely to occur in the electronics industry, where
   expensive and complex production facilities have been moved offshore
   over a period of several decades. In particular, China has taken
   advantage of the West's offshore production model and its associated
   technology transfer to develop a manufacturing capability that has
   resulted in the ``China Price{''} in electronics. As a result, China now
   has the infrastructure and electronics supply chain necessary to produce
   a wide range of products, from simple components to embedded systems and
   systems integration. This gives China the capability to produce complex
   electronics applications domestically, including computers, automotive
   controls, medical instrumentation, avionics, and even sophisticated
   military command and control systems. The resultant gain in Chinese
   capabilities, commensurate with the loss in Western capabilities through
   use of the offshore production model, makes the repatriation of the
   electronics industry to its former bastions in the United States and
   Western Europe doubtful. This will have a strong impact on resource
   allocation, research planning, and innovation. The authors present their
   argument through a series of brief case studies.}},

Abstract = {{H. \& R. Johnson (India) Limited in Gujarat. This case is written at a
   time when organized retailing in India was booming, opening up
   opportunities for numerous big indigenous and foreign players. Also,
   with the rising disposable incomes of the Indian middle class and their
   changing tastes and preferences, they were becoming more and more
   demanding. The case is written at this crucial juncture of the changing
   economy wherein a mammoth like H. \& R. Johnson, with a rich lineage of
   product and process innovations and international and domestic (Indian)
   market leadership needed to make the best out of the changing economy.
   Should HRJIL ride the retail wave by offering different products from
   its broad range of products, like ready-made kitchens, living rooms and
   the like; or should the company, given its dreams and present
   capabilities, utilize the unmet customer service gaps to provide
   services required of laying tiles, and in the process, develop servicing
   capabilities to become an end-to-end solution provider to its customers.
   The purpose of this case is to enable students to practice making
   decisions for the company at this important point in time with regard to
   the market opportunities by considering the capabilities and the core
   competencies of the company, its business model, and the existing
   distribution network.}},

Abstract = {{International technology transfer (ITT) processes are complex, risky,
   and often fail. When financial services organisations have the
   opportunity to transfer their business model and core technologies to a
   foreign market, comprehensive research into the technology and the
   market is compulsory. Numerous applicable theories and models in
   technology transfer were reviewed to develop a comprehensive ITT model.
   Interviews with key individuals and focus group sessions were used to
   rank factors that affect the success of ITT in the financial services
   industry - specifically, a case in the direct short term insurance
   industry. These success factors were implemented in the developed market
   evaluation model where the user is required to enter evaluation values
   for each factor. The evaluation model then delivers a value that
   represents the market potential. This model can be used to evaluate one
   market or many potential markets. There are two factors that an
   organisation must always be aware of: the influence stakeholders have on
   the ITT process, and what ITT strategy is employed. Further research is
   proposed to validate the developed model beyond the specific case study.}},

Abstract = {{Under the prerequisite that virtual markets need a unit of analysis
   different than traditional markets, a business model was created as the
   unit of analysis for this research. In order to help choose an Internet
   business model that creates the most value, evaluation indexes for
   value-creation potential of Internet business models are developed. AHP
   method was used for this Study.
   In the first stage of the deduction process, the improved profits and
   the reduced costs factors are classified as quantitative and qualitative
   evaluation indexes with two dimensions are extracted by related studies.
   Then, the evaluation indexes are corrected, complemented and verified
   through the expert interview, and analytic hierarchy.
   The results were the improved profits dimension outweighed the reduced
   costs dimension, and each qualitative effect outweighed each
   quantitative effect. The overall consistency index showed to be 2\%,
   which means that all the experts are determined to have rational
   consistency.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an architecture and protocol infrastructure for a
   novel consumer-oriented incoming call connection (ICC) service. In the
   ubiquitous consumer wireless world (UCWW) this service is one of the
   core services requiring new infrastructural solutions for its
   realisation. The solution proposed here, besides realising the service,
   will offer mobile users greater flexibility and management control over
   incoming calls, enable users to receive incoming calls via multiple
   access networks/providers through a single identity, enable user-driven,
   seamless, network-transparent hot access network change (HAC), largely
   end roaming charges and create a new wireless networking business
   opportunity among other benefits. The main components and interfaces of
   the ICC service architecture and infrastructure are described, and
   protocol candidates are suggested. A generic consumer-oriented ICC
   service scenario is elaborated theoretically, implemented and
   experimentally verified for voice over IP (VoIP) connections in a
   testbed environment which includes network-transparent HAC. Two distinct
   ICC operational modes are identified and compared in respect of relative
   signaling latency and processing resources for a number of key functions
   such as session setup and release, and HAC.}},

   obtain benefits, users have free access to specific services, service

Abstract = {{A business model is presented in which space-themed entertainment and
   educational media are harnessed to the goal of designing and financing
   the establishment of a self-sustaining Mars outpost. The model draws
   from two precedents: (i) The National Geographic Society's use of media
   sales to fund research and (ii) the historical role of patrons in the
   process of creativity. These precedents are combined in an international
   non-governmental organization (INGO) that is governed by the individuals
   who participate in the media businesses branded by the INGO - these
   individuals constitute a patron base of several tens of millions.
   Requiring only modest penetration into global media markets,
   expenditures of USD 5 billion per year (in 2008 dollars) can commence in
   2025 and continue at an accelerating rate until the Mars outpost is
   established. The financing approach utilized, combined with a decision
   authority that is free to consider a broad range of solutions, will
   advance the technical state-of-the-art and result in an Earth-Mars
   infrastructure capable of expanding the initial Mars Outpost into
   humanity's first second home.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter narrates the strategic resource management practices of the
   Bishop Technology Group, an innovative Australian organization. The case
   study focuses on this in the context of the creative and commercial
   aspects of technology innovation. The creative aspects of technology
   innovation were managed through the development of a creative culture,
   an open management style, participation in decision making, supportive
   structures, the use of performance measures, and patenting. The
   commercial aspects were addressed via the development of the firm's
   business model. The coupling of these creative and commercial elements
   of technology innovation may be understood in terms of key themes
   characteristic of the notion of strategic resource management championed
   by Birkett (see Coyte 2009 in this publication), namely balancing
   tensions between short- and long-term perspectives, continuity and
   change, focus and flexibility, and adequacy and expectations with
   respect to organizational resourcing.
   Everybody loves the garage tinkerer who sells his brainchild to a big
   company and becomes a billionaire; and everybody sympathises with the

Title = {{Business Model for Commingled Operations of Freight and
   Non-FRA-Compliant Passenger Rail Services}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2009}},
Number = {{2112}},
Pages = {{86-92}},
Abstract = {{It is a challenge to develop a business model of commingled operations
   of freight and non-FRA-compliant passenger rail services because there
   are no domestic cases of such operations and the number of cases in
   which freight and light rail transit (LRT) equipment share tracks on a
   temporal basis of separation is limited. Greater opportunities for
   commingling may be created, however, because in many domestic cases
   public passenger transportation and private freight operations share
   track and there are many proven international experiences with
   commingled operations of LRT and freight services. This paper identifies
   and describes the components recommended for inclusion in the business
   models for both freight railroad operations and public transit agencies
   for the potential implementation of relevant shared-use operations.
   These components include shared-use agreements related to costs,
   capacity, risk sharing, and insurance on the basis of both domestic and
   international experiences. Building on the experiences of existing
   shared-use operations and the plans under development, the authors have
   constructed a business model that can serve as a starting point for
   future operations.}},

Abstract = {{The fixed/portable broadband wireless access is becoming a necessity for
   many residential and business subscribers worldwide. The demand is
   exploding as the pricing of broadband services is rapidly decreasing.
   The worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX) technology
   is an integral part of the portfolio by complementing 2G/3G mobile
   access, Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) broadband fixed access, and
   Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) hotspot access. In this chapter, an extended
   overview of WiMAX and its applications in higher generation wireless
   networks as a cost-effective solution to answering the challenges posed
   by the digital divide is presented. Technology behind WiMAX and its
   network architecture, design, and deployment are examined in addition to
   factors that impact WiMAX planning and performance. A WiMAX radio
   coverage simulation and analysis at different frequency bands for
   different demographic is presented. Furthermore, the WiMAX business
   models and a comparison with two enhanced third-generation (3G)
   technologies that are potential competitors to WiMAX are explored. The
   chapter concludes with identification of some of the applications,
   benefits, and drawbacks of WiMAX mobile networks.}},

Abstract = {{In the past few years, DNV has been involved in a variety of projects
   related to marine energy converters. All projects have been
   characterized for the handling of technical uncertainties due to the
   application of new technology or proven technology in different areas of
   application. A systematic approach based on the DNV RP-A203
   Qualification of New Technology was applied combined with the Guidelines
   for Design and Operation of Wave Energy Converters (May 2005-work
   carried out by DNV under Commission of Carbon Trust as part of Marine
   Energy Challenge) to steer the third party activity, but, more
   importantly, to allow developers to systematically identify and deal
   with the risks in a rational manner with traceability of decisions
   throughout the development of the energy converter. From the very start
   of our engagement, it was clear that the handling of technical
   uncertainties was affected, not only by the technical barriers, but also
   by financial and time constraints. The establishment of the safety and
   functional targets to be achieved by the energy converter are to be
   based, not only on the safety and asset integrity aspects, but also on
   the financial/business model. The experience of using the qualification
   process and the guidelines on these projects, achieving the right
   balance between the constraints, handling of uncertainties, financial
   targets, and safety and functional requirements, are briefly described
   in this paper as well as the future steps to be taken to improve the
   process and consolidate the experience so far. In this paper, the use of
   the DNV OSS-312 (Certification of Wave and Tidal Energy Converters) on
   the certification process of marine energy converters is also addressed.}},

   open business model were defined. Requirements and methods for the
   authentication of users or devices to such multi-service access networks
   were elaborated. The concept of Internet Protocol (IP) sessions was
   reviewed and options for monitoring IP sessions were compared. Pragmatic
   recommendations for the implementation of resource admission control and
   policy decisions were formulated. The paper also describes how the
   requirement to support nomadic services influenced some of the
   architectural choices for the authentication and policy framework. A

   system dynamics approach, the positive dynamic interconnections studied
   by Koiranen and Chirico (2006) between knowledge, capabilities, dynamic
   capabilities, entrepreneurial performance, and transgenerational value
   in family business. New insights emerge when analyzing family inertia in
   the model (as a function of paternalism) that influences the creation of
   capabilities and dynamic capabilities negatively, although with some
   exceptions. We conclude that although a paternalistic behavior can be
   positive in guiding and training offspring at the beginning of the
   activity, it may become less crucial if it persists over time preventing
   change even when it is needed. Family firms should be able to understand
   the long-term effects and results of actual events, decisions and
   behaviors, and, at the same time, prevent their negative consequences.}},

Abstract = {{With the continued advances of information technology into content
   management and production workflows, broadcast facilities are becoming
   largely information technology (IT)-centric operations, leveraging
   proven enterprise-class server and network technologies. A major
   exception to this trend, however, is the broadcast transmission process
   (master control and playout), which remains heavily dependent on
   specialized broadcast hardware. In this process, transmission of a
   moderately complex television channel can involve a dozen or more
   specialized hardware components linked by an automation system. In many
   cases, the costs associated with this traditional approach to broadcast
   transmission can be prohibitive for internet protocol television (IPTV)
   and other new operators intending to set up and manage their own playout
   facilities. Furthermore, to compete head-on with mainstream broadcast
   channels, new service providers need to match the quality standard and
   aesthetics that an increasingly discerning audience has come to expect.
   The ability to move the transmission process to an IT platform opens the
   door to an entirely new business model for broadcasters. With a
   fully-featured broadcast transmission chain provided by a software
   solution operating on industry-standard IT servers rather than
   specialized broadcast hardware, it is now possible to build and operate
   a broadcast transmission center as an extension of an IT-centric
   enterprise.}},

Abstract = {{The Turin Municipality, the Piedmont Region and the Province of Turin
   developed a shared document management platform to support
   administrative procedures. These Institutions took advantage of open
   source concepts, stimulating the local production fabric, thus producing
   positive results also for the local IT companies. The DoQui project sets
   up a complex technological solution in a dynamic context, such as ECM
   (Enterprise Content Management), from rather strict sector requirements,
   in terms of user class (public institutions), and territorial scope
   (Piedmont Region or Italy). The project sets up a friendly solution for
   ICT companies, so as to create a community willing to share the project
   idea and enable a business model able to target both Public
   Administration and private sector, as both need efficient document
   management solutions. Hence, the aim of this initiative is to answer the
   needs of the promoting public institutions, but also to create
   opportunities and new value chains.}},

Title = {{New directions for the biopharma industry in Canada: modelling and
   empirical findings}},
Journal = {{MANAGEMENT DECISION}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{5-6}},
Pages = {{880-893}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The main purpose of this study is to identify features and
   trends shaping the business models currently prevailing in the Canadian
   biopharma industry, by disaggregating the business model analysis into
   four key areas: value creation, investment strategy, business strategy,
   success factors
   Design/mlethodology/approach - Results arise from an empirical fieldwork
   of qualitative nature, under-taken by the end of 2004, involving deep
   interviews to a broad variety of key stakeholders of the biopharma
   industry in the Quebec region, including biopharma firms, large pharma
   firms, venture capital funds, research centers and recognized experts
   from consultancy firms and Universities.
   Findings - Biopharma firms encounter difficulties to bridge the gap
   between the research innovation focus to the large scale production
   focus. The biopharma firms need to announce achievable and promising
   hits in the near future, mainly by filing patents and also through
   scientific publications, and making believable their prospects to reach
   the release phase. Venture capitalists and private investors claim for
   original, innovative and marketable results, keeping away from just
   imitative enterprises. The one product firms still largely prevail.
   Research limitations/implications - Lessons learned through this
   fieldwork might in the future be complemented with a quantitative survey
   to biopharma firms in the Quebec region.
   Practical implications - When funding biopharma firms, private investors
   claim for original, innovative and marketable results, keeping away from
   just imitative enterprises. The business model must evolve, and take
   into account the quick changes in the environment, coming either from
   the market or from the technologies and research streams.
   Originality/value - Disaggregating the business model analysis into four
   key areas will make an original contribution to the limited knowledge
   about expectations and future prospects of the biopharma industry.}},

Title = {{Retail value chains: extension and development into transition economies
   Stockmann in Estonia and Latvia}},
Journal = {{BALTIC JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{309-327}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - In the area of international retail expansion the most
   challenging issues that firms struggle with are: which countries to
   expand to; which order to do it and what are the retail drivers that can
   be readily exported to the new market versus which have to be market
   specific? The purpose of this paper is to look at one specific retailer
   and review how they have addressed these questions.
   Design/methodology/approach - The approach used is based around a case
   study of the expansion of the Stockmann department store into Estonia
   and Latvia. Using the findings of empirical research, qualitative and
   quantitative, the research shows how Stockmann has both built upon and
   exported its original home strengths while also focusing on which
   drivers had to be tailored to the local marketplace.
   Findings - The case study found that there are some differences between
   the performances of Stockmann across the two Baltic countries, but the
   level of performance is quite high in most areas of retail operations.
   This supports the position that a multinational can successfully expand
   in diverse markets. In other words, although there are minor issues, on
   balance the regional versus country specific issues have been
   substantially resolved. Even national issues like skilled labour
   shortages and developing good practices for handling returns have been
   resolved at a medium level. Areas for improvement were in pricing and
   handling merchandise returns.
   Research limitations/implications - The findings are limited to one case
   study, of one retailer, and the fact that the study was over a defined
   period. This is a general limitation of case studies, but the use of
   multiple research methods, and methodologies helped to strengthen the
   research findings and interpretations.
   Practical implications - This study has presented the retail value chain
   as a model consisting of three main drivers: service; retail operations
   and country of origin aspects. The three constructs were found to be
   valid representations, enabling an assessment of a retailer's
   performance in multiple countries. The lessons drawn indicate that a
   business model used in the home country can be a powerful integrating
   and controlling tool for managing the multinational expansion, but that
   there is also a need to include consumer perceptions and evaluations of
   retailer performance. These operational measures continue to represent
   one of the best sources of data in understanding a retailer's
   performance, in both developed and converging countries such as Estonia
   and Latvia.
   Originality/value - This paper presents a useful case study of a
   retailer that has expanded from its home base into a number of
   countries, all of which fall into the category of transition economies,
   and adds to the literature covering expansion into transition economies,
   which is a little known field in Baltic journal of Management terms of
   the expansion of one's value chain or value proposition}},

Journal = {{MANAGEMENT DECISION}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1414-1436}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe a case that looks at
   how an innovative plastics packaging company in Portugal integrates
   itself into the value chain of company clients. The pedagogical
   objectives are: to present a success case in technological, processes
   and business innovation; to present a success case in business strategy,
   based on the build-up of partnerships; and to construct a platform for
   discussion of a first mover strategy, and precautions to be taken in its
   pursuit.
   Design/methodology/approach - A range of evidence, including primary and
   secondary data, was used in the writing of this case, namely: direct
   observation, interviewing, press releases and press cuttings, annual
   reports, customer records and organization charts.
   Findings - Logoplaste has gained a leadership position and has
   successfully managed to achieve a relevant position in the international
   landscape by seeking a vertical integration of its activities, in order
   to obtain a better value proposal for its clients, which, at the same
   time, allows it to capture a part of that value for itself. This
   practice has permitted this company not only to grow overseas but also
   to reveal a customer loyalty performance of 100 per cent. These results
   are deeply connected with their innovative value proposal, e.g. product
   innovation, process innovation, marketing innovation and business model
   innovation.
   Originality/value - This study provides insights into the nature of a
   company, which has successfully developed its activity based on a strong
   investment in innovation since its genesis. Logoplaste's strategy can be
   considered distinctive as it combines and integrates the following
   strategic vectors: integration of the client's logistical and value
   chains, based on a process of partnership developments; investing in
   R\&D of packaging engineering, with the offer of an, ``vend-to-end{''}
   solution; and production process based on a ``wall-to-wall{''} model.}},

Abstract = {{In Germany the EMS sector has to face many difficulties in the near
   future among which the long-ranging shortage of emergency physicians and
   the constant monetary burden are just the most prominent. The solution
   to these problems is seen in the development and employment of an
   eHealth telemetric support system for EMS. The long-term success of such
   a system is determined by human, organisational and technological
   factors. Hence an integrated approach for the development of an eHealth
   system for EMS has to be applied. In this context the paper focuses on
   the development of an appropriated business model. It examines the
   methodology for business modelling in the eHealth sector and gives first
   insights to the market for EMS eHealth services.}},

Abstract = {{The search for efficient business models for open source software is a
   hot topic both for software vendors and for customers and users of
   software. In this paper we investigate possibilities for a network of
   municipalities in Sweden, Sambruk, to use an open source business model
   for their procurement of software solutions. More specifically, the
   procurement of public e-services has been followed in seven case
   studies, of which one was studied in-depth and is accounted for in
   detail in this paper. The results are that municipalities' investments
   in e-services are important both concerning function and long-term cost
   of ownership. Open source software, OSS, can be ail alternative, but in
   the studied procurement cases it appeared not to be a realistic choice
   in practise. This paper investigates why, and the conclusions are
   presented as general results. The authors also suggest ail alternative
   business model referred to as Sambruk Community Licence, ie a semi-open
   source software business model for local governments.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new cooperation business model in which hybrid
   traders exist. We define hybrid traders as new traders on the Internet.
   Hybrid traders can become both buyers and sellers. We assume that hybrid
   traders do not have enough money. To buy items cheaply, hybrid traders
   cooperate with other traders. In regard to buying items, we consider a
   volume discount-based trading. We propose a mechanism in which trader
   cooperates, buys in a lot of goods, and increases own utility. Our
   mechanism adopts side payment to promote increasingly cooperation with
   traders. Cooperative traders commit participation based on a value of
   side payment. We extend mechanism which hybrid traders deal with
   multiple items. This mechanism shows new decision of side payment and
   proposer's strategy.}},

Abstract = {{The demand for ``competitive{''} administrative salaries, the
   gravitation of curricular control to the administration, and the
   establishment of explicitly for-profit universities are just a few
   aspects of the ways in which higher education is becoming
   indistinguishable from business. In the United States higher education,
   once seen as a public good, with cost a secondary concern to benefit, is
   increasingly described as a service bought and paid for like any other,
   subject to the same considerations of efficiency and productivity, and
   restricted to those who can afford it. What are the origins of this
   change of construal, and what are its consequences for the breadth and
   quality of higher education in this country? In Section 1 below I will
   provide a brief examination of the metaphorical precursors to the
   business model. In Section 2, I will examine the mapping of the business
   model to the university, and provide examples. In Section 3, I will
   explore some of the consequences of this construal.}},

Abstract = {{Repeated unnecessary expenses are generated at worldwide scale with
   tremendous impact, particularly on less favoured countries. We envision
   the emergence of Communities of users sharing knowledge, information
   processing, Communication, storage and content for their specific domain
   of interest within an innovative generic platform-independent middleware
   framework, called OpenAdap.net (OAN), which is not bound to a specific
   type of information. The key to this vision is an Open Source
   development based on Open Standards that provides Community members with
   pervasive access points like web portals, desktop and mobile
   applications. Internet Communities will have the possibility to
   transparently compose meta-resources based on the resources available in
   their own Community, as well as in Communities with semantically related
   interest, by means of a network-centric operating system driven by the
   activity of intelligent adaptable brokers. The win-win business model of
   OpenAdap.net is based on the adoption of OAN and the development of the
   brokers thanks to an Open Source and patent-free policy. This model is
   aimed at the widespread dissemination of knowledge without economical
   barriers, e.g. at no cost to the Communities that will rely on this
   system, and contains no profit motivation whatsoever. A case study
   illustrates how collaborative working is actually implemented by OAN in
   a Community of scientific researchers. The potential benefits appearing
   with the growth of the adoption of OAN open the way to unlimited Third
   Parties and added-value services with an embedded advantage for
   worldwide competitive businesses and less favoured Web users.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: To describe the establishment and development of an Early Psychosis
   Intervention Programme in Singapore that is based on a business model
   and with concepts drawn from the corporate world.
   Methods: The author who directed this programme describes the
   circumstances that led to this initiative, the ideas borrowed and
   adapted from the corporate world, and the lessons learnt in setting up
   this intervention programme. The modus operandi of the programme is
   based on the Balanced Scorecard - a model which stresses four equally
   important components: customers, internal processes, financial health
   and learning and innovation. Other complementary actions like creating a
   sense of urgency, forging a vision with a core ideology, empowerment of
   team members, creating short-term wins, anchoring the changes and
   finding meaning in the work are vital for the programme to thrive.
   Results: This model also emphasizes the importance of accountability
   through the measurability of indicators. These indicators included a
   significant reduction in the duration of untreated psychosis, a positive
   change in the referral patterns with better engagement of the primary
   health-care sector and an improvement in the quality of care for the
   patients.
   Conclusions: Much can be learnt from the business world in building and
   maintaining a public mental health programme. Effective change also
   requires effective leadership, and the successful implementation of
   certain strategic steps.}},

Abstract = {{Digital goods, such as multi-media, music files, animation e-books,
   online consulting, and application software, are now traded globally
   online. The new business model created with digital goods faces various
   risks, some of which are unprecedented in the traditional trading of
   physical goods. Thus, companies producing digital goods should
   understand the new risks. in order to properly trade the digital goods.
   This research presents supply chain activities which are involved in
   digital goods from producing the components to globally selling digital
   goods to consumers. Furthermore, it has identified a comprehensive list
   of numerous risks involved in the global online trading of the digital
   goods, presents a risk factor framework with four categories (i.e.,
   environmental risk, strategic risk, technological risk, and operational
   risk), and shows a newly developed framework for establishing a risk
   management system for trading digital goods globally online.}},

Abstract = {{The Internet and IP technology have become the modern amenities, and are
   expected to become ICT infrastructure to support the future ubiquitous
   digital society. However, they show several vulnerabilities at present.
   Hence next generation lifeline and new digital business/revenue creation
   can be established by deploying dependable ICT systems.
   This paper focuses on the concept designs of dependable networks, these
   architecture and emerging technologies. And new business creation is
   another aspect. Network-based new services/businesses can survive if and
   only if the network dependability is guaranteed. This topic is discussed
   as business model schemes in this paper. We also discuss antinomy
   relations between dependability and ``ease-of-use,{''} and open issues
   such as the social consensus.}},

Abstract = {{`Innovation' has become a keyword in many countries; to support
   innovation, a better publication system for academic articles is needed.
   In this article, a proposed new system is discussed. The current
   title-based contract between publishers and libraries has caused a
   serious information gap, particularly in small institutes. In the new
   model, called the `beneficiary-pays' model, sales are at the individual
   article level, and not that of the journal as a whole. In addition, the
   publication cost of poorly accessed articles is borne mainly by authors,
   whereas that of frequently used articles is paid mainly by readers. The
   feasibility of the new model is discussed. The two currently practised
   models,author-pays' and `reader-pays', are compared with the
   `beneficiary-pays' model. It is doubtful if journals operating under the
   `author-pays' open access model can ever acquire the reputation based on
   quality that is needed to motivate authors to pay high enough fees to
   finance the entire publication cost. The new variant of the user-pays
   model, in which libraries pay not for a subscription, but in proportion
   to the number of times the journal is accessed, is a fairer business
   model; however, the beneficiary-pays model is more sensitive to
   high-impact works.}},

Abstract = {{Ethernet provides a simple, cost-effective solution for transporting
   enterprise data applications that is fast replacing traditional private
   line and frame relay services. However, carrier-class Ethernet
   architecture is still evolving and transport vendors need a flexible
   architecture that provides a hedge against the timing and extent of
   migration to Ethernet. Ethernet over Synchronous Optical Network (SONET)
   provides a viable architecture that allows service providers to start
   offering Ethernet service without overcommitting themselves, while
   protecting their embedded base. This paper presents an economic
   evaluation of Ethernet-over-SONET architecture based on a number of
   scenarios that serve as building blocks for service provider network
   transformation. We construct a business model that evaluates the various
   alternative strategies available to the service provider to address
   bandwidth demand growth and simultaneous migration from legacy to
   Ethernet services. (c) 2007 Alcatel-Lucent.}},

Abstract = {{Information and banking technology have combined to throw the retail
   banking business model into disarray. Many predicted that lower cost
   online-oriented services such as Citibank's Citi f/i venture would
   dominate the retail banking market and drive out high cost old
   technologies. The subsequent failure of Citi f/i and other virtual banks
   raises questions about how technology choice affects retail banking
   competition: Under what conditions would an online-only banking strategy
   be successful? When can a bank deploy both old and new technologies and
   still be competitive? Can an ATM network substitute for a branch
   network? Do customers' attitudes about technology affect banking
   strategy? We use an economic model of a competitive retail banking
   market to address those and other questions. Our model allows banks to
   choose their technology, including establishing separate branch and ATM
   networks or relying on third party ATM networks. We also include
   customers that have differing attitudes toward technology. Our analysis
   suggests that customer preferences, rather than technology cost
   structure, drive the evolution of banks' strategic technology choices.
   Also, banks in our model tend to deploy ATMs in the same numbers as
   branches, despite ATM's cost advantages. Finally we show that virtual
   banks will remain unprofitable until a much larger proportion of the
   population is comfortable with online bank transaction technology. These
   results suggest that banks should carefully study their customers'
   preferences to align major strategy shifts with customer attitudes.}},

Abstract = {{Along with the diversification of customers' demand, there is an urgent
   need for a business model to realize the mass customization in
   automobile industry. When the volume and quantity of orders from
   customers is changing dynamically, it is difficult for a maker to
   realize both productivity and a variety of customers' specification by
   itself. So, we propose a new collaboration between the maker and
   supplier in a supply chain structure about ``load leveling{''} to
   supplier. Firstly, we describe a framework about the cost structure in
   accordance with ``load leveling{''} to the supplier and estimate the
   increased cost. Specially, we formulate the volume about load leveling
   and the maker's increased cost. Next, we derive the total increased cost
   estimator in the supply chain and analyze it. Finally, we get the
   optimal load leveling with minimum increased cost and get some
   information about designing the supply chain structure between the maker
   and supplier to realize mass customization.}},

Abstract = {{eHealth is one of the new mainly discussed topics. Many definitions have
   been given to capture this topic. We define eHealth as a
   consumer-centred model of health care where stakeholders collaborate,
   utilizing ICT, including Internet technologies to manage health,
   arrange, deliver and account for care. and manage the health care
   system{''}. A new eHealth patient classification is proposed. Two
   potential generic business models are presented, indicating the value
   flows between the different actors. The model has been furthermore
   elaborated for the Flemish situation for people who require an
   independent living system. All cash flows between the actors are
   presented. Some conclusions will be drawn from the proposed models.}},

Abstract = {{With the increasing development of 3G packet switched based networks,
   combined with the availability of advanced multi-mode terminals, a wide
   variety of new applications is becoming available. A fundamental
   requirement for a mass market adoption is an easy to use user interface.
   This paper introduces an innovative user interface for mobile TV. This
   new concept, which relies on the well known presence technology,
   provides notification and personalization as key features. The Mobile TV
   user is therefore able to enjoy new broadcast services (e.g. DVB, DVA)
   just by customizing preferences. We argue this opens new business
   opportunities and share revenue for Mobile Operators. The paper also
   describes an implementation prototype showing how the technology could
   work in a real deployment scenario. A business model, supporting the
   above considerations, is also provided.}},

Abstract = {{The cost of reticles is growing twice as fast as the overall cost of new
   process development for technologies beyond the 100-nm node {[}1],
   {[}2]. In order for the integrated circuit design to continuously
   benefit from the shrinkpath in alignment with Moore's law {[}3], the
   industry should explore cost-effective approaches for the mask data
   {[}(intellectual property (IP)] placement alternative to the standard
   methodology of one mask for one layer of one product {[}4]. The
   implementation of multi-IP placements, using multilayer or multiproduct
   (shuttle) masks, is based on complex technical and economical analysis
   to maximize mask return on investment (ROI) over the product lifetime.
   The key criteria include the ability to match layers or products on one
   plate with respect to the CD control and pattern density and the
   expected time or fab volume prior to the conversion to the dedicated
   mask set for successful products. This work analyzes the links between
   the IP content of the mask, the product market price, and the wafer
   volume. As an example, by taking into account the cost of the exposure
   and of the mask, one can show that for 100-nm technology, positive ROI
   would be achieved for a product or test vehicle with volume depending on
   the architecture of the multilayer mask set. We compare the key
   challenges of the two basic multi-IP mask approaches, the multilayer and
   the multiproduct masks, and discuss the best conditions for their
   implementation. Directions for future research are also proposed.}},

   mark the start of a new era of innovation in business. The m-commerce
   products and services, which are being formed with the help of wireless
   technology, will drive the emergence of new business models at the same
   time as the products and services themselves will help shape new user
   contexts. The wireless products and services will reshape the world of
   the users and the routines they use in their everyday life, which in
   turn will change the way they perceive ``how things should be,{''} that
   is, their ideas of what is possible and valuable. (Take, for example,
   the Short Message Service {[}SMS], which replaced part of voice
   communications and offered an easier method of nonurgent communication
   than the phone.) These changes will drive the emergence of new value
   systems that will extend the way organizations conduct business-and

Abstract = {{Internet service providers (ISPs) face exploding demand from business
   and consumers for service aspects such as quality-of-service, mobility,
   geographical reach, and seamless functionality integration. As their
   service capabilities are stretched thin, they often find it difficult to
   provide satisfactory services. In this paper, we introduce the notion of
   topographical leverage in providing Internet services and develop the
   concept of capacity provision networks (CPNs). A CPN enhances Internet
   service providers' service capabilities by pooling all providers'
   underused resources and supplying them as needed. Through several
   industry-specific examples we illustrate the viability and business
   value of the CPN concept. We further develop a model of business and
   market forces impacting business decisions to trade and collaborate
   among the various players in the Internet service industry. The business
   implications of a CPN are also discussed. In particular, we believe our
   research should give rise to several innovative business models in the
   Internet service industry, where the concepts of trading and
   collaborating as envisioned in CPNs are likely to become predominant in
   the future.}},

Abstract = {{Component technology plays a key role in the field of software reuse.
   Components can be reused under various business environments through its
   changmibility This paper proposes a feature-based semantics model of
   reusable component, which describes semantics of components by using
   domain feature space and expresses changeability of components through
   five kinds of changeable mechanisms of domain features. In addition,
   this study proposes a self-contained classification of features
   according to enterprise business model, divides semantics structure and
   hierarchical relation of three kinds of components, and sets up mapping
   relations between semantics model of component and business model. The
   model is verified through the case study of a Web-based information
   platform for logistics enterprise.}},

   based on open standards that will provide the higher interoperability.
   It is also a new business model to gain correctly and maintain safety
   certain personal attributes and supplies them to service providers under
   user's agreements. If various personal attribute providers are linked to
   one other, the common platform would be developed among multiple
   industries over the Internet. In terms of the technological feasibility,
   the personal attribute provider can adapt the existing communication
   technologies such as SAML and Liberty, and the maximum use of such
   technologies can extend various capabilities of information systems that

Abstract = {{In May 2005 the SITMO project came to an official end. During 20 months
   the consortium was intensively working on the project idea of developing
   and deploying an electronic mobile system for Bilbao city travellers.
   The vision of the SITMO project was to offer tourists a broad array of
   location based information and services during their city breaks by
   providing them an end to end advanced mobile tourism device that would
   become an automated mobile tourist guide. SITMO business model offered a
   complete innovative and customised service for clients and tourists,
   adding value to the tourism value chain. Another key aspect of SITMO was
   that it would also help to promote the use of 2.5/3G cellular networks
   in the Spanish market. With these overall objectives in mind six
   companies from different branches came together to put into practise the
   innovative and future orientated mobile business idea.}},

Abstract = {{e-COMODE is an open digital learning environment, which assists young
   students (10-17 year old) in creating models. e-COMODE services aim to
   offer a collaborative modelling environment, including pedagogical,
   technical and implementation support services. The market validation of
   the different services has been performed in different environments,
   private and state schools, from different geographical areas; Greece,
   Spain and North Ireland in the UK, in order to confirm the business
   model developed and the services acceptance. Outcomes show that e-COMODE
   services benefit schools by providing mechanisms to solve the lack of
   sufficient and appropriate teacher's support to incorporate new
   technologies in their teaching practices, to implement collaborative
   learning in the educational systems and the learning via computer based
   modelling. Although end-users (teachers, students) have already adopted
   the e-COMODE facilities, the barriers for the exploitation of the
   services are at the level of the public administration. Therefore, the
   business model proposed is being revised in function of the experience
   gathered during the market validation.}},

Abstract = {{In traditional business model, the buying decision process is poorly
   coordinated among the human decision-makers. Therefore, a long-lived,
   adaptive, and autonomous application called software agents, that can
   perform tasks such as personalization, brokering, and negotiation in
   e-commerce is much needed. These applications reside at the buyers' side
   or at the sellers' servers. The purpose of this paper is to research
   into possible deployment of software agents in a framework for
   c-commerce buying decision process. This paper overviews the traditional
   business model, the Consumer Buying Behavior (CBB) model, and also
   covers the requirements needed for minimizing human interactions in
   buying decision processes. The research proposes a software agent's
   framework in which, two main approaches, namely Automated Collaborative
   Filtering (ACF) and Better Business Bureau (BBB), are merged to produce
   better agents in assisting buying decision process. The framework will
   enable the agents to get the best price for a good product from a
   reputable merchant.}},

   delivering content and services over the wireless Internet, is regarded
   as one of the key emerging areas in electronic business. Whereas
   adoption and usage of mobile business in several markets has remained
   far behind initial expectations, the case of NTT DoCoMo's i-mode in
   Japan is a famous example for success in mobile business, with many
   players at different steps in the mobile value chain thriving at the
   same time. In our analysis, we assume a perspective different from the
   existing approaches for explaining i-mode's success. Analyzing the
   economics of the i-mode system, we argue that NTT DoCoMo has been able
   to install its business model and secure its own position by employing a
   novel strategic management concept, which we term ``value scope

Abstract = {{New technologies in telecommunication services require new business
   models. Inadequate payments for UMTS-licences and the end of the
   Internet-hype forced industries to describe themselves as `alchemists'
   and search for the `killer applications'. Therefore different ideas of
   using content within such new technologies arose. Since the use of
   content for these new applications might have legal implications not
   specifically covered by existing laws this search raises hotly-discussed
   questions.
   When considering the business model it is important to understand if
   licences, notifications or the like are required, or if other
   restrictions exist. The paper discusses the difference between
   broadcaster, cable provider and simple information-service providers. In
   particular, the status of Internet-based TV and radio services is
   discussed and how law differs between terrestrial and cable services
   (for example, between DVB-T and DVB-C).
   As copyright law is very strict, the implications of such laws are
   discussed. However, this article focuses on transmission and on-demand
   services. In addition, this paper alludes to legal obligations to be
   considered when providing content services.}},

Abstract = {{As microprocessors keep entering into more and more devices around us,
   there is a growing potential for service innovation, comfort and
   individuality. In particular, context-based applications promise to
   intelligently follow the specific needs of the individual user. However,
   complexity around us is growing. Who will handle the many ways of
   configuration? Who will keep intruders, spam and malicious software
   away? Who will care for software updates in this environment? If there
   is a trend from personal computers to personal networks, it certainly
   demands new ways of configuration management in order to live up to its
   promise. Handling a mess of CD-ROMs, as with today's PCs, including
   individual downloads from the Internet and paper clips to follow up a
   variety of serial numbers, keys and passwords hardly seems to be a
   viable way into the future. Also, unlike a professional intranet, the
   costs of maintaining personal networks and home networks will only allow
   for a modest amount of manual administration. Such networks will need to
   be self-organising and will need to provide innovative means for
   maintenance and configuration management. This paper describes potential
   technologies to provide self organisation of networks, as well as
   potential solutions for configuration management. As a potential
   business model for the provisioning of configuration management,
   identity management may be provided as a service (for example, by a
   mobile network operator), as well as configuration management for
   specific classes of devices as a service of an ASP.}},

Abstract = {{How to deal with digital rights is one of the main problems to solve
   when implementing systems for music distribution on the Web. Even when
   the business model problem is clarified, there are still technical
   problems to solve, such as the interchange of digital rights information
   and control over their use. Using a Rights Expression Language (REL)
   helps solve this problem. Although there are several international
   initiatives to standardise a REL, we mainly focus on the approach
   followed by MPEG-21, which in fact is trying to converge from existing
   alternatives. This article presents a new reference implementation of
   the ongoing standard, and raises the idea of specifying a subset of the
   REL standard (i.e., a profile) to ease its implementation. By analysing
   what the existing websites for music distribution are doing, we come to
   the conclusion that a specific profile for music distribution could be a
   starting point.}},

Abstract = {{In an era of downsizing and disposable ethics, there is a need to
   redefine the role of business in society. Central to such a discussion
   is the frame of reference of the entrepreneur. A traditional business
   model defines entrepreneurship based on endowing resources with new
   wealth producing capabilities. This paper defines entrepreneurship as a
   calling to endow resources with new value. In support of the impact such
   a distinction would have on repositioning the role of business in
   society, the paper weaves together writings from the Pope, Drucker, and
   Lonergan, with emphasis on applying Lonergan's discussion of bias to the
   discussion of ethics in business. Adapting the term, ``lifesizing'',
   which was coined by the author in a previous article, to
   entrepreneurship, the paper takes the position that lifesized
   entrepreneurship can act as a catalyst similar to Lonergan's cosmopolis
   and play a key role in countering bias and repositioning the role of
   business in society.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{We simulate the process of possible interactions between a set of
   competitive services and a set of portals that provide online rating for
   these services. We argue that to have a profitable business, these
   portals are forced to have subscribed services that are rated by the
   portals. To satisfy the subscribing services, we make the assumption
   that the portals improve the rating of a given service by one unit per
   transaction that involves payment. In this study we follow the `what-if
   methodology, analysing strategies that a service may choose from to
   select the best portal for it to subscribe to, and strategies for a
   portal to accept the subscription such that its reputation loss, in
   terms of the integrity of its ratings, is minimised. We observe that the
   behaviour of the simulated agents in accordance to our model is quite
   natural from the real-would perspective. One conclusion from the
   simulations is that under reasonable conditions, if most of the services
   and rating portals in a given industry do not accept a subscription
   policy similar to the one indicated above, they will lose, respectively,
   their ratings and reputations, and, moreover the rating portals will
   have problems in making a profit. Our prediction is that the modem
   portal-rating based economy sector will eventually evolve into a
   subscription process similar to the one we suggest in this study, as an
   alternative to a business model based purely on advertising.}},

Abstract = {{Industrial SMEs that export complex products rely on their commercial

   high degree of communication, collaboration and trust amongst the
   different agents operating in them. Starting from the ``Community of

   Distribution Network Relationship Management (DRM) intends to strengthen
   the relationships within distribution networks by means of a business
   model and a software application that consists of a workspace portal for
   cooperative work and several ad hoc developments for the management of
   crucial distribution network processes. This paper emphasizes the
   alignment of the DRM solution implementation with the strategy of these
   companies, the involvement of top management and the measures adopted to
   take over the barriers to the use of the solution. Finally, the results
   of the research and the business benefits for these kinds of SMEs are

Abstract = {{We report on an experience in analyzing the security of the Trust and
   Security Management (TSM) protocol, an authentication procedure within
   the OSA/Parlay Application Program Interfaces (APIs) of the Open Service
   Access and Parlay Group. The experience has been conducted jointly by
   research institutes experienced in security and industry experts in
   telecommunication networking. OSA/Parlay APIs are designed to enable the
   creation of telecommunication applications outside the traditional
   network space and business model. Network operators consider the
   OSA/Parlay a promising architecture to stimulate the development of web
   service applications by third party providers, which may not necessarily
   be experts in telecommunication and security. The TSM protocol is
   executed by the gateways to OSA/Parlay networks; its role is to
   authenticate client applications trying to access the interfaces of some
   object representing an offered network capability. For this reason,
   potential security flaws in the TSM authentication strategy can cause
   the unauthorized use of the network, with evident damages to the
   operator and the quality of services. We report a rigorous formal
   analysis of the TSM specification, which is originally given in UML.
   Furthermore, we illustrate our design choices to obtain the formal
   model, describe the tool-aided verification and finally expose the
   security flaws discovered.}},

   in federations of digital libraries (DL). Inspired by e-commerce
   technology, we recognize CPU-processing and queries (and query answers)

   a task of trading CPU-processing, queries and query-answers. We show
   that our framework satisfies the needs of modem DL federations by
   respecting the autonomy of DL nodes and natively supporting their
   business model. Our query processing conception is independent of the
   possible distributed architecture and can be easily implemented over a
   typical GRID architectural infrastructure or a Peer-To-Peer network.}},

Abstract = {{In most P2P business models, in which users purchase the media, it is
   necessary to securely identify the user in order to facilitate payment.
   This paper presents a technique for allowing the widespread sharing of
   certain media formats including music using a method that keeps track of
   media possession and other marketing information, but in a way that does
   not require user identification. For the user, the main attraction of
   this scheme is that their identity is not a requirement, usage of
   reduced-quality media within this system is free and that extended media
   search is facilitated as an attraction to remain within the system. The
   content creators and distributors are compensated by this system by them
   having access to potentially large-scale actual usage and music trading
   statistics. The preliminary system design presented here, can cleanly
   coexist with a full-quality music purchase business model, also
   described briefly.}},

Abstract = {{This manuscript is one of two written to celebrate the 25th Anniversary
   of the American College of Toxicology (ACT). This history of ACT
   describes its evolution from an entrepreneurial, risk taking model to a
   conservative business model, fully accepted in the scientific community.
   ACT started with a small group of scientists who were dissatisfied with
   the relatively narrow approach to full membership then taken by the
   Society of Toxicology (SOT). They were excited by new research and
   collaborative opportunities resulting from an enhanced public awareness
   of the impact of chemicals on the environment and emerging new
   methodologies to evaluate human risks of exposure to be chemicals and
   pharmaceuticals. These toxicologists, many of whom were from industry
   and government, rather than academia, were tired of being considered
   second class citizens and envisioned more open and cross-disciplined
   approaches. They favored balanced input by academia, industry and
   government in the overall toxicologic evaluation and risk assessment
   process. The history of the founding and early development of ACT, as
   well as the College's growth and eventual acceptance into the scientific
   community, including its impact on the status quo during the Society's
   first 25 years, are told by its successive presidents.}},

Abstract = {{One of the main impediments in wide scale deployment of multicast is
   lack of a good business model. Any technology needs a good business
   model to succeed. In this article we present a simple business model for
   multicast in the Internet that uses the inherent benefits of multicast
   to make it profitable to all the parties, including the multicast
   sender, multicast receivers and the network providers, that are
   involved.
   Our model is based on the following principle. Multicast receivers
   should not pay any additional fee for receiving multicast over unicast
   but might pay for the content, the sender pays for the bandwidth used in
   multicast to the Internet service provider(s) (ISP) and might charge the
   receivers for the content. We demonstrate that the use of our model
   proves profitable to the sender, receivers and the ISPs. We also discuss
   some deployment issues. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present a technology which enables wide-scale deployment of a unique
   and powerful data access and search tool. This tool makes it possible
   for content owners on the Internet to offer end-users the ability to
   search, assess, or otherwise examine their nondisclosable private data.
   The end-users may use arbitrary, distrusted assessment algorithms and
   receive the results which are produced. These results take the form of a
   meaningful digest, e. g., a useful statistic, a relevance assessment,
   etc. There exists some controllable danger of information theft which,
   however, is quantitatively dependent on system parameters and can be
   tuned accordingly. We consider a broad class of practical applications
   where brute force attacks exist which are easier and cheaper to
   implement than an attack through appropriately configured PIVOTS, making
   our system, effectively, very trustworthy. The actual creation of the
   search algorithm may be performed by the end-users themselves in
   specialized applications, or by third-party search-engine operators who
   offer their services to end-users. Sophisticated data mining
   technologies which are very often not directly available to content
   owners can thus be exploited to mine even private data collections.
   Users discovering interesting items in private data sets may purchase
   this specific data, but other desirable exploitation possibilities are
   also analyzed. A novel business model is presented and its potential for
   great impact on e-commerce is explored. Three diverse and important
   real-world applications are presented in conclusion.}},

   traded over public business-to-business electronic marketplaces (B2B
   e-MPs) using a business model. The transaction data for six months over
   an e-MP dealing with maintenance, repair, and operating (MRO) products
   were acquired, and the spatial flow of the products traded over the e-MP
   was analyzed based on two business models: an exchange model and an
   agent model. The analysis showed a differentiated spatial impact by the
   business model. Customers with the exchange model strongly preferred
   intraregional suppliers. However, those following the agent model tended
   to be supplied from interregional suppliers. Although the items involved
   with the agent model were mainly the standardized operating inputs, the
   high ratio of interregional suppliers in the agent model were revealed
   irrespective of the types of products traded.}},

Abstract = {{The Ackoff-Gharajedaghi Model of System Types distinguishes 3
   fundamental empirical systems: deterministic, animate, and social, with
   regard to their purpose. It has been formulated models and theories. It
   is argued here that this model is also valuable for the interpretation
   and design of actual, empirical business systems. A study of a
   malfunctioning business is presented and interpreted with the
   Ackoff-Gharajedaghi Model, which supports this argument. Additionally,
   the study shows a pragmatic value of the proposed ``Imperative of Goals
   Alignment{''} for the design of business systems, which is an
   operationalization of the Ackoff-Gharajedaghi Model. Furthermore, the
   investigation illustrates the importance of clear goals and incentives
   in business design; and it supports the thesis of the
   Ackoff-Gharajedaghi Model that management models and theories, founded
   upon empirical observations of deterministic and animate systems, impose
   limitations on the design of business systems.}},

Abstract = {{The introduction of telecommunication services on commercial flights for
   passengers and airline crew requires a careful balance in the value
   chain in order to offer services at reasonable prices, and thereby speed
   up the market acceptance. Thus, a comprehensive business model is needed
   that addresses all types of services, licensing, billing, roles of the
   interested parties, and the relation of the business model to system
   architecture.
   Services like Web browsing and E-mail can be offered without licensing
   issues. Mobile telephony and short message service (SMS) require
   licensing, and most likely, both the involvement of mobile operators and
   roaming agreements, for rapid market expansion. This paper describes the
   different actors likely to participate in the business model. Of two
   alternative business models, one is preferred that may simplify system
   architecture, enabling operators to maintain virtually unchanged
   networks. The impact of the preferred business model on the billing
   system is described in some detail.}},

Abstract = {{RIO is the primary active queue management technology for handling
   AF(assured forwarding) class traffic for services that have minimum
   bandwidth guarantees. However, RIO unfairly allocates the excess AF
   bandwidth among LSPs(label-switched paths) which have TCP flows
   aggregated as AF class in a DiffServ-Capable MPLS Network. This issue
   obstructs the business model in which ISPs promote LSP users to expand
   the LSP-required bandwidth for enriching the quality of AF traffic. In
   this paper, we propose a way, called weighted fair RIO (WT-RIO), to
   resolve this issue. WF-RIO can allocate the excess AF bandwidth among
   LSPs in proportion to their AF minimum guaranteed bandwidth by
   multiplying the dropping probability of RIO by an LSP-specific weight
   which is simply calculated from the traffic rates for the individual
   LSPs. We evaluate the proposed method by computer simulation and
   demonstrate its effectiveness.}},

Abstract = {{Barriers to the utility of general aviation were identified through a

   examine further some of these barriers and their impact on general

   increasing the utility of general aviation transportation. Improved
   weather information as well as near all-weather capability for general
   aviation aircraft and better access to ground transportation at the
   travel destination would significantly increase utility. Furthermore,
   modifying the business model for owning and operating general aviation
   aircraft may be the best near-term strategy for lowering the expense of
   general aviation transportation. Analysis with the mode choice model
   also indicates that increasing the cruise speed of general aviation
   aircraft does not necessarily translate into an increase in the utility
   of general aviation transportation.}},

Abstract = {{The encouragement of a consumer-directed insurance market and the
   involvement of corporate America have led to a transformation of the
   healthcare system that will redefine patient expectations and the role
   of the physician. The expectation of a higher level of customer service,
   the role of electronic media, and an earnest regard for healthcare by
   the patient will impact the physician. Consumer-directed healthcare will
   call for a reprioritization, focusing on service, convenience,
   competency, quality, and low cost. Indifference to patient courtesies or
   failure to become involved in modern technology may cause the physician
   to be bypassed from this new healthcare system. As the business world
   integrates the business model into the medical profession, healthcare
   organizations will restructure themselves into well-organized business
   enterprises employing physicians. The singular physician may no longer
   be competitive with such business enterprises, leading to consolidation
   of organizations and a significant decision for the physician. The
   physician will have the unusual opportunity to either remain exclusively
   a medical professional or to also venture into the business world as an
   equity investor, participating in financial growth possibilities of
   those medical practice organizations that are for-profit. With the
   emergence of these new equity models of healthcare, the primary focus
   will be on profit, production, and service efficiencies. It is the
   responsibility of the physician to maintain professionalism and the
   commitment to quality and appropriateness of patient care. However, at
   the same time, the physician has the unique opportunity to participate
   in the distribution, economics, and subsequent financial profit of
   healthcare. The medical experience of the physician, coupled with
   business acumen, will be an unbeatable combination.}},

Abstract = {{One role of a business system is to provide a representation of a
   Universe of Discourse, which reflects its structure and behaviour. An
   equally important function of the system is to support communication
   within an organisation, by structuring and co-ordinating the actions
   performed by the organisation's agents. These two roles of a business
   system may be represented in terms of business and process models, i.e.
   separating the declarative aspects from the procedural control flow
   aspects of the system. Although this separation of concerns has many
   advantages, the differences in representation techniques and focus of
   the two model types constitute a problem in itself. Abstracting business
   semantics out of, for instance, technical messaging protocols poses
   severe problems for business analysts. The main contribution of this
   paper is a unified framework based on agent oriented concepts for
   facilitating analysis and integration of business models and process
   models in a systematic way. The approach suggested bridges the gap
   between the declarative and social/ economic aspects of a business model
   and the procedural and communicative aspects of a process model in a
   technology independent manner. We illustrate how our approach can
   simplify business and process models integration, process specification,
   process pattern interpretation and process choreography.}},

Abstract = {{Today's trend in Web engineering is the automation of Web service
   interoperation. With this aim, web content is noted with semantic
   information, using Web Semantic languages. Web Services is becoming the
   leading technology that provides functionality of an enterprise. This
   functionality carries out the activities that form a process. Business
   processes are a set of activities that can be seen as offered business
   services. Therefore, this article presents a process to derive web
   services specifications and service composition from business models.
   The paper considers DAML-S as the web services markup language to
   represent the description of web services and specify their composition.
   Rational Unified Process business model is the language used as input.
   The article shows the set of derivation rules that allows the atomatic
   generation of DAML-S modules from business models.}},

Abstract = {{Decision making support has evolved over time and across disciplines
   {[}3] with much research focusing on ways to improve such support. In
   the process, there has been an evolution from simple data access and
   reporting to complex analytical, creative support. Meanwhile electronic
   business planning, a complex process, that can be facilitated through
   management science, economics, statistics, and other technological
   tools, has shown great promise for overall business control and
   management in the new E-era. However, managers are rarely aware of these
   tools, are unskillful in their use, unwilling to, or incapable of,
   acquiring the proficiency. In this ongoing project, we intend to explore
   bow decision making support systems (DMSS) can facilitate electronic
   business planning by deriving an operational e-business model and
   illustrating how the model can be delivered through a DMSS. Such
   delivery will enable managers to measure and evaluate the impact of
   plans on electronic business performance.}},

Abstract = {{SPACEHAB, Inc. has established a commercial business model for providing
   access to space. The model, based on private initiative and investment,
   has offered ``turn key{''} access to space including both launch and
   integration and operations services. Some features of this business
   model should be applied directly to providing service in the ISS era:
   offering packaged service at a fixed price; customer focus; private
   investment as the basis for offering services; and efficient and
   continually improving customer service. But International Space Station
   (ISS) will pose challenges that have not been pioneered in the STS era:
   a new base of customers must be developed; on-orbit hardware will be
   more difficult to modify; access to ISS is controlled by government
   space agencies. These problems will tax the ingenuity of those who wish
   to provide services in space on a commercial business model. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{The underlying premise for this chapter is that a solution for DRM
   protection and related issues must be found on the business side, i.e.
   the solution must present itself within a business model, as technical
   solutions will always be temporary ad infinitum, resulting in endless
   revisions, upgrades, catch-up efforts, and improvements. There is no
   question that evolving and future distribution systems for images, music
   and movies will be digital and the distribution itself will be
   electronic via networks and e-channels. This contribution explores this
   setting in terms of economic and organizational underpinnings of
   electronic markets, networks and channels. We can presently observe the
   evolution of value networks, value-adding channels, as well as entire
   value webs in the distribution (and value) chain. A value web is a
   customer-driven network of independent firms who use information
   technology to coordinate their value chains to collectively produce a
   product or service for a market. Finally, we address some of these
   observations, descriptions and discussions in the context of DRM,
   specifically the music and movie industry. We will offer some insights,
   address current developments, but also some speculations how these
   industries may (and quite possibly must) progress.}},

Abstract = {{Recent years have shown a dramatic decline in telecommunications
   profits. At least three main reasons for this can be identified:
   1 the lack of proper business planning in the IP services sector
   resulting in high investments which were not met by sufficient revenues;
   2 over-extension in banking loans to cover for wild investments in UMTS
   licences, resulting in interest commitments that put a too heavy burden
   on, normal revenue generation; and
   3 the incredible price erosion for trunk capacities, resulting in a
   serious almost non-recoverable gap between investments per megabit and
   revenues, per megabit.
   Only recently we have seen major and seemingly successful companies
   (Global Crossing, Carrier 1, GTS, KPN-Qwestdagger) hit the rocky shores.
   It is clear that the telecommunications world operates in a
   non-sustainable business model which cannot last much longer. This paper
   analyses the problem causes and gives directions for solutions for a
   return to a potential healthy telecommunications business environment.}},

Abstract = {{Many of the proposed applications for the 60 GHz unlicensed band are
   extremely cost sensitive;for example, consumer-oriented broadband
   wireless access over the last one hundred meters. In some instances the

   MMIC foundries now offer devices that operate in the 60 GHz frequency
   range, but these devices have performance limitations and cost
   penalties, relative to lower frequency devices, that dictate careful
   evaluation of system design tradeoffs. This article explores these
   tradeoffs, such as noise figure, power output, linearity and freqnency
   stability in the context of waveform choices and link performance, and
   suggests an optimal class of waveforms for the band and chosen

Abstract = {{In the past few years, the electronics industry has undergone an
   explosion in new products and technologies. This fierce global
   competition has resulted in the decision by many companies to outsource
   manufacturing in order to concentrate on research and development,
   marketing, and sales. This has given rise to a number of companies who
   solely provide electronics manufacturing services. Exchange of
   information between product developers and contract manufacturers,
   especially information about product demand, is critical to the success
   of this business model. In this paper, we analyze forecast data obtained
   from a local contract manufacturer in order to better understand
   forecast variability and its reasons. We find that forecast variability
   tends to increase as the production period approaches, despite common
   belief that forecasts get better with time. We also discuss the impact
   that chronic material unavailability and product mix have on forecast
   variability. Finally, we see that unmet demand pushed in the next
   production period can distort forecasts and result in unrealistic
   expectations.}},

   developed in a proper way, e.g. not competing in the mainly digital core
   competence markets of the big foundaries but concentrating on
   specialised niches, such a model will work. For a sustainable growth
   scenario it is necessary to establish and maintain sufficient

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{For many, the advantages of always-on (A 0) are still not clear and the
   concept can be difficult to understand and distinguish from traditional
   network connections. How important is the ability to be AO compared to
   other network characteristics? What will be the quality of the service
   (speed, availability and reliability) and which services will take full
   advantage of AO? Is it important to be able to control the information
   flow? What will be the business model for AO services - would it be
   cheaper or more expensive than other networks? What are the security and
   privacy concerns, and are there any social consequences such as less
   face-to-face contact and user isolation?
   The paper starts by describing the work done to capture the users'
   attitudes and expected behaviour towards AO. This includes a review of
   the initial testing of the AO concept through a number of focus groups
   and the development of usage scenarios to illustrate the possibilities
   for AO services. The results from a number of AO user trials are also
   presented. These user trials were carried out in five different European
   countries and provide a snapshot of different AO services across Europe.
   The trials identified a number of technical and operational issues for
   AO services and the paper makes recommendations for the operation of AO
   services, and the implications for AO terminals, devices and services.
   The user trials identified a significant difference between being
   `always-on to a network' and being `always-on to a service'- which seems
   to be a much more compelling proposition for users. This is further
   explored in this paper with a description of some ongoing research work
   investigating this issue through the development of a device-unifying
   service (DUS) which provides users with a single virtual terminal for
   all of their devices and access to persistent network-based services,
   which are `always-on'.
   This work was undertaken within EURESCOM, the European Institute for
   Research and Strategic Studies in Telecommunications, a leading
   institute for collaborative R\&D in telecommunications. It was completed
   as two separate projects (P1003 `Exploiting the always-on concept, and
   P1101 `The device-unifying service) with different collaborative
   partners in each.}},

   models and process models. While a business model is concerned with

Abstract = {{Today's use of mobile phones is mostly for coordination purposes. It
   seems reasonable to assume that 3G and 4G high bandwidth systems will be
   used in a similar way. This paper therefore suggests to create a
   framework for ``visual coordination{''} as a particular form of
   synchronous collaboration. It involves the creation of structured object
   spaces, including multimedia data, on which coordination takes place.
   The contribution emphasizes the two essential elements for CSCW, namely
   a shared view and concurrency awareness. It seems likely that a very
   small set of generic navigating operations is sufficient to generate a
   consistent interaction model with a uniform look and feel. Moreover, the
   object space can be provided by third parties in a network neutral
   format like XML. To turn collaboration spaces into a business model,
   however, research communities from fields like databases, document
   processing, groupware, interface design and mobile communication must
   join their efforts.}},

Abstract = {{To stay competitive in an ever-changing, consolidating industry, poultry
   companies must learn how to effectively and efficiently innovate and
   then implement new technologies. Moreover, an efficient process must be
   in place to successfully choose winners from losers. An objective of
   this process, therefore, must be to make quick, accurate decisions that
   minimize organizational efforts and expenses associated with evaluating
   and implementing new technology opportunities. With these concepts in
   mind, embracing an effective portfolio management strategy is paramount
   to extracting commercial value from new technology developments.
   Likewise, managing risk must be an integral aspect of any new product or
   portfolio management program whose key objective minimizes losses within
   the organization while allowing for the greatest probability of overall
   success.
   This paper will discuss the importance of portfolio risk assessment and
   management; provide a description of an effective process to manage risk
   while enhancing success, especially as it relates to new opportunities
   or technology alternatives under consideration; and discuss tools to
   manage the process, including the effective management of the research
   and development (R\&D) function such that it is effectively aligned with
   product development objectives. Finally, some discussion will focus on
   how the modern poultry industry might apply some of these principles and
   concepts toward implementing an effective new product and technology
   program.}},

Abstract = {{For many, the advantages of always-on (AO) are still not clear. The
   concept of AO can be difficult to understand and distinguish from
   traditional network connections. How important is the ability to be AO
   compared to other network characteristics? What will be the quality of
   the service (speed, availability and reliability) and which services
   will take full advantage of AO? Is it important to be able to control
   the information flow? What will be the business model. for AO services:
   would it be cheaper or more expensive than other networks? What are the
   security and privacy concerns, and are there any social consequences
   such as less face-to-face contact and user isolation?
   This paper presents a definition of the always-on (AO) concept and
   describes the work done to capture the expected user's attitudes and
   behaviour towards AO. This wilt include a review of the initial testing
   of the AO concept through a number of focus groups. There will also be a
   resume of the usage scenarios which illustrate the possibilities for
   desirable AO services, and the results from a number of AO user trials
   wilt also be presented. These user trials were carried out in the five
   partner European countries and provide a snapshot of different AO
   scenarios across Europe. The paper will also survey possible AO
   applications and services, reviewing AO network access technologies and
   identifying the technical and operational requirements for AO services.
   This work described in this paper was completed within a collaborative
   EURESCOM project between British Telecommunications, Telenor, CSELT,

Abstract = {{Clinical development executives realize that their processes must be
   enabled by technology and other process innovations in order to handle
   the capacity, speed, and efficiency challenges of an increasingly
   competitive business environment. Technology companies are pushing for
   ever-more rapid iterations of generational change in software, systems,
   and information-handling, from improved versions of traditional clinical
   data management systems to electronic data capture, and on to electronic
   clinical trials and business intelligence. The business model for using
   and paying for these technologies is increasingly complex and confusing
   compared to the traditional sponsor/vendor relationship, with sponsors
   having the opportunity to decide how much and what is kept inside or
   provided from outside services.
   This paper reviews these conditions and evaluates strategies that
   corporate executives can follow in selecting and implementing the
   technologies and business models that are right for their operations
   today and in the short-term future. Managers must approach this complex
   matrix of information and options with a process for decision making,
   and understand the operational implications, costs, and benefits of each
   path. The paper covers the need to prepare the organization tactically
   after the strategy is selected, and the tasks required to implement new

Abstract = {{Agent-based economy or agent-based electronic commerce is the term for
   describing one of possible next steps of electronic commerce. The
   systematic understanding of the agent-based economy is important for
   researchers to develop practical intelligent agent systems, and for
   current electronic commerce industries to cope with the challenges of
   the intelligent agents. With these purposes, we conduct a comprehensive
   review of ongoing and future impacts of intelligent agents to electronic
   commerce from business model perspective. We classify intelligent agents
   by their functions and roles in electronic commerce and analyze the
   business model change by intelligent agents, based on Timmers's
   definition of business model. Changes in architecture of flows,
   responses of players, influences to revenue model and participant's
   benefits, and funding source are discussed with real world business
   examples and related researches. We also discuss the limitations of
   intelligent agents in electronic commerce.(1)}},

Pages = {{531-538}},
Abstract = {{Specialty pharmacy service (SPS) companies are filling a new niche in
   the expanding role of chronic disease management (DM). These companies
   distribute expensive biotechnology drugs to patients who have relatively
   uncommon but very expensive chronic diseases. Although there are
   considerable differences among the competitors, some of the SPS
   companies have evolved into organizations that have built data systems
   and processes rivaling those offered by dedicated DM companies. These
   data systems and processes will allow several of the companies to
   demonstrate improved medical outcomes.
   Since the SPS companies can fashion contracts where they do not charge a
   separate fee for the DM portion of their services, this model is
   especially attractive to managed-care organizations (MCOs) {[}both
   preferred provider organizations and health maintenance organizations]
   and to third-party administrators that operate in self-insured or
   administrative services only environments. These companies can also
   reduce the administrative burden for MCOs and the `hassle factor' for
   physicians and patients by performing delegated prior-authorization
   functions for the MCO.
   Pharmaceutical companies have played a key part in advising and
   assisting the development of the unique role of SPS companies. Future
   challenges and opportunities for this sector include: integration of
   comorbid conditions; publication of outcome results; customization of
   educational material to individual patient needs; and accreditation.
   MCOs and investors will recognize the development of an integrated,
   proven DM, outcome-driven business model as a key differentiation factor
   in this niche industry.}},

Abstract = {{The general design problem in serial production lines concerns the

   rates, and buffers given production-specific constraints, associated
   costs, and revenue projections. We describe the design of exPLOre: a
   modular, object-oriented, production line optimization software
   architecture. An abstract optimization module can be instantiated using
   a variety of stochastic optimization methods such as simulated annealing
   and genetic algorithms. Its search space is constrained by a constraint
   checker while its search direction is guided by a cost analyser which
   combines the output of a throughput evaluator with the business model.
   The throughput evaluator can be instantiated using Markovian,
   generalised queueing network methods, a decomposition, or an expansion
   method algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{A benchmark is used to measure and compare the performance of like
   systems. It is also used to estimate the scalability of a system in
   terms of the number of users and/or transactions that a system can
   support and system response times under different loads and
   hardware/software deployment platforms. Because of the multidimensional
   aspects of e-commerce and the various emerging and distinct e-commerce
   business models, one single benchmark is not suitable for the purposes
   of examining scalability and determining throughput and response time of
   e-commerce applications. This paper advocates development of suites of
   benchmarks based on distinguished business models that represent
   existing and emerging e-commerce applications in terms of their distinct
   features. In particular, the paper develops a benchmark for one such
   business model, a model that is based on a cybermediary or electronic
   broker, e-broker. Two implementations of the benchmark specification are
   described: one based on Microsoft's COM technology while the other one
   is based on CORBA technology. Sample benchmark results are presented and
   discussed. The paper also proposes a framework for development of a
   suite of e-commerce benchmarks.}},

Abstract = {{Through the current explosion of the Internet, service consumers expect
   advanced Internet services become more customizable and easy to use. So,
   Service Providers must be able to deploy and manage such services,
   reducing the time to market of its services while drastically improving
   the Service Quality. However, the current Internet technology is lacking
   when it comes to developing and deploying new services, integrating
   together service offerings. This paper proposes a platform architecture
   for Internet Service delivering and management. We also introduce the
   concept of ``basic service component{''} as an extension of the notion
   of building block defined by the TeleManagement Forum and as a way to
   build business services in a flexible manner. Our proposal makes full
   use of the Telecommunications Information Networking Architecture (TINA)
   Business Model with some adaptations to fit with our component-based
   approach.}},

Abstract = {{Raffinerie Tirlemontoise's business approach has been based on quality
   almost since its inception. Modern sugar technology, well perceived
   consumer products, good quality control practices and certified quality
   assurance systems have been well integrated for many years now in a
   company-wide Total Quality Management (TQM) approach. However with a
   continuously good operating result and a stable market environment there
   is not much incentive remaining to continuously do better. Because of
   uncertainty about the future the senior management decided in 1994 to
   use the model of the European Foundation for Quality Management (EFQM
   Model) as a tool to analyze all the business processes and to set strong
   targets for breakthrough. As a result, among others, the following were
   achieved:
   - a clear strategic direction, directly translated into short and long
   term projects,
   - plans led to several diversifications and acquisitions,
   - customer satisfaction was significantly improved due to measure ment,
   - improved complaint handling, contractor management and proc ess
   control,
   - an increased focus on people's competence, personnel development and,
   involvement resulted into higher productivity and improved safety,
   - safety, quality control, quality assurance, HRM (Human Resource

Abstract = {{This paper argues that all network providers in a connectionless
   multi-service network should offer each class of their service to each
   neighbour for each direction at a single price. This is called
   ``split-edge pricing{''}. If sets of customers wish to reapportion their
   networking charges between themselves, this should be tackled
   end-to-end. Edge reapportionment should not be muddled with networking
   charges, as is the case in the telephony market. Avoiding the telephony
   approach is shown to offer full reapportionment flexibility, but avoids
   the otherwise inevitable network complexity, particularly for multicast.
   ``Split-edge pricing{''} is recursive, applying as much to relationships
   between providers as to edge-customers. Various scenarios are discussed,
   showing the advantage of the approach. These include phone to Internet
   gateways and even inter-domain multicast conferences with heterogeneous
   QoS. The business model analysis suggests a new, purely financial role
   of end-to-end intermediary in the Internet industry.}},

Abstract = {{The ACTS FlowThru project aims to build a management system that
   supports the flow of management information across organisational and
   technological domains by reusing components that have been developed by
   other ACTS projects. After analysis of the available components, it was
   decided to split the trial business system into three parts. The
   problems addressed by each of the three subsystems were taken from each
   of the three business process areas identified in the TeleManagement
   Forum (TMF) Telecoms Operations Map: fulfilment (i.e. service
   provisioning and configuration management); assurance (i.e. adherence to
   SLAs, fault and performance management) and accounting (i.e. service and
   network metering and charging). This paper elaborates on the realisation
   of the accounting system. This system consists of a TINA-based
   implementation of multimedia service access and control on top of ATM
   switching networks. Accounting components are introduced both at the
   service and network level. The accounting components sere responsible
   for correlating network and service level accountable events, resulting
   in a single bill for the service subscribers. Using the Accounting
   system as an example, the paper also illustrates the development
   methodology and guidelines adhered to by the FlowThru project. The
   reader is assumed to be familiar with the TINA business model {[}1] and
   to have at least a high-level overview of the TINA service {[}2] and
   network resource architecture {[}3] concepts. Some notion of the
   notational conventions adopted by the Unified Modelling Language (UML)
   is also assumed {[}9].}},

Abstract = {{Recently, as the Internet service technology has been activated and
   popularized, digital contents industry is increasingly attracting
   attention as a promising industry. Digital content is a material or
   information that appears with the development of information and
   communication technology. It is represented by a sign character, voice,
   sound, image and video. This digital content industry has been applied
   to various disciplines. P2P service model is being used as a new
   business model in the field of digital contents industry. P2P service
   model is the most important factor in constructing a collaboration
   system between users. In other words, as more users collaborate, such as
   sharing content, contributing computing resources, etc., the network
   becomes rich in data. In addition, smooth traffic processing can be
   ensured through contribution of computing power. Conversely, as
   collaboration between users decreases, the resources of the P2P system
   become exhausted, which can lead to system collapse. Therefore, this
   paper developed a system for creative English education for young
   children. To this end, we designed and developed an English education
   system that can generate interest by applying augmented reality(AR) and
   implemented which is based on the P2P network service model. Finally, we
   provide virtual multimedia education contents using augmented reality
   and build a system environment applying P2P network service model
   method. Based on this, we implemented the functions such as learning

Abstract = {{The business model has evolved as an important concept in strategic
   management. While recent years have seen substantial progress in the
   business model's conceptual development, empirical progress remains
   limited. I argue that this limited progress might be due to a mismatch
   between the business model's characteristics and the methods applied to
   study it. This essay introduces two methods-qualitative comparative
   analysis and system dynamics simulation-that share key characteristics
   with the business model concept. The essay introduces these methods and
   discusses five directions for applying them in business model research.
   In doing so, I hope to contribute to a stronger harmonization of
   conceptual and empirical business model research.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the enhancing of life quality, increasing of chronic diseases,
   changing lifestyles, and an expanding life expectancy, rapid population
   aging requires a new business model that promotes happiness and
   emphasizes a healthy body and mind through the ``anytime, anywhere
   well-being{''} lifestyle. Recently, lifecare systems using IoT devices
   are being released as products that are influential on the overall
   society, and their effectiveness is continuously proven. In addition,
   based on peer-to-peer (P2P) networking, diverse companies are conducting
   investments and research to develop devices as well as solutions that
   connect to these devices. Accordingly, in this study, a mining-based
   lifecare-recommendation method using a peer-to-peer dataset and adaptive
   decision feedback is proposed. In addition to collecting PHRs, the
   proposed method measures life-logs such as dietary life, life pattern,
   sleep pattern, life behavior, and job career; the P2P-dataset
   preprocessed index information; and biometric information using a
   wearable device. It uses the Open API to collect the health-weather and
   life-weather index data from public data, and it uses a smart-band-type
   wearable device known as a biosensor to measure the heart rate, daily
   activity, and body temperature. It monitors the current status and
   conditions through the classification of life data, and it mines big
   data and uses a decision tree to analyze the association rules and
   correlations, as well as to discover new knowledge patterns. In the
   peer-to-peer networking, a lifecare recommendation model that uses
   adaptive decision feedback has been developed for the peer-to-peer
   platform. This adaptive decision feedback reflects an individual's
   importance or sensory level. Accordingly, it proposes more
   individualized and flexible results and can be configured to support
   intellectual lifecare. A mining-based lifecare-recommendation mobile
   service can also be developed to enhance the quality of life, as it
   provides user-based health management and reduces the medical expenses;
   accordingly, it enhances the service satisfaction and quality in the
   lifecare field.}},

Abstract = {{The vivid and rapid development of the Internet motivates cloud-based
   intelligent information systems to be applied. Mobile e-commerce, as a
   new business model based on cloud computing in intelligent service, has
   become the mainstream of mobile applications. It not only provides
   efficient computation services for both trading parties, but also gives
   a secure and reliable data storage center. However, privacy and
   accountability have become one of users' crucial concerns in mobile
   e-commerce transactions. In this paper, we present a practical and
   efficient accountable mobile e-commerce scheme that is based on cloud
   platform to address the fundamental transaction requirement. We propose
   the concrete construction and demonstrate that the proposed scheme can
   provide effective security in the transaction process, and also give the
   practical deployment in cloud computing systems to provide the
   intelligent information services. We also give the performance analysis
   and show it is efficient and practical compared with related methods in

Abstract = {{The rapid growth of new computing paradigms such as Cloud Computing and
   Big Data has unleashed great opportunities for companies to shift their
   business model towards a fully digital strategy. A major obstacle in
   this matter is the requirement of highly specialized ICT infrastructures
   that are expensive and difficult to manage. It is at this point that the
   IaaS (infrastructure as a service) model offers an efficient and
   cost-affordable solution to supply companies with their required
   computing resources. In the Big Data context, it is often a hard task to
   design an optimal IaaS solution that meets user requirements. In this
   context, we propose a methodology to optimize the definition of IaaS
   cloud models for hosting Big Data platforms, following a threefold
   criterion: cost, reliability, and computing capacity. Specifically, the
   proposed methodology hinges on evolutionary heuristics in order to find
   IaaS configurations in the cloud that optimally balance such objectives.
   We also define measures to quantify the aforementioned metrics over a
   Big Data platform hosted within an IaaS cloud model. The proposed method
   is validated by using real information from three IaaS providers and
   three Big Data platforms. The obtained results provide an insightful
   input for system managers when initially designing cloud infrastructures
   for Big Data applications.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of degrowth aims fundamentally at reducing material and
   energy throughput equitably, while questioning the desirability of
   further economic growth. In order to achieve this reduction of society's
   throughput, radical changes in the ways goods and services are produced,
   distributed and used are required. In this think piece, concepts of
   consumer integration into the value creation process and (new) enabling
   technologies are discussed as possible constituting elements of
   alternative organizational models in a degrowth society. To date,
   collaborative value creation concepts, such as crowdsourcing and mass
   customization, have been discussed almost exclusively as business model
   patterns for companies in economies that are set to grow. The same
   applies to the assessment of (new) technologies, such as additive
   manufacturing, web-based user interfaces for co-creation, and other
   flexible production technologies that allow for collaborative and
   individualized production. Potential positive and negative effects of
   these concepts and technologies with regard to the objectives of
   degrowth are discussed in order to initiate a debate about the inclusion
   of CVC for the design of alternative organizational models that are in
   line with degrowth thinking. This think piece illustrates that several
   elements of collaborative value creation and its enabling technologies
   coincide with degrowth objectives but do not lead per se to their
   attainment. Thereby, a starting point for future (empirical) work in
   this area is generated. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reviews the experience of a for-profit firm in Rwanda
   promoting biomass pellets and a fan micro-gasification improved
   cookstove as a clean cooking alternative to charcoal. Consumers purchase
   locally produced biomass pellets and receive the improved cookstove on a
   lease basis. The cost of the pellets and stove(s) is lower than the cost
   of cooking with charcoal in the urban setting where our study takes
   place. Inyenyeri has been piloting its business model since 2012. Using
   data from an ongoing quantitative impact evaluation study, focus group
   discussions, and a series of key informant interviews, we chronicle the
   firm's experience with stove choice, pellet production, and marketing,
   highlighting lessons for the design of private sector-led clean cooking
   interventions.
   We find that 38\% of households marketed to as part of our ongoing
   impact evaluation study adopted the pellet and stove system, but that
   approximately 45\% of those who adopted suspended contracts after
   signing up. The firm's experience with stove choice, pellet production,
   pricing structures, and customer service strategies have influenced
   implementation, adoption rates, and scale-up. Customer preferences for
   specific stove attributes and willingness of stove manufacturers to
   modify stoves for local conditions have influenced both the firm's
   choice of stove and customer satisfaction. In 2015 the firm transitioned
   customers from the Philips stove to the Mimi Moto, a decision which
   created confusion among consumers, and affected adoption rates. Despite
   the challenge of establishing and scaling-up pellet production in
   central Africa, the firm increased production 400\% between 2014 and
   2017 to reach 800,000 kg/year. Importing and maintaining pelletizing
   equipment in Rwanda is costly, the supply of feedstock irregualar, and
   undercapitalization of the firm have affected production. With respect
   to marketing, after experimenting with a sign-up fee and a minimum
   monthly purchase of pellets, the firm has decided to transition to a
   pay-as-you-go system to reduce perceived risk by consumers. A high-level
   of customer service including in-home visits, free in-home repair, and
   home delivery of pellets are major innovations. The long pilot phase and
   the evolutionary nature of the firm's activities illustrate both the
   complexity of building a market for clean cooking, and the time required
   to understand nascent markets and consumer demand. (C) 2018 The Authors.

Title = {{Profiting from innovation in the digital economy: Enabling technologies,
   standards, and licensing models in the wireless world}},

Abstract = {{The value-capture problem for innovators in the digital economy involves
   some different challenges from those in the industrial economy. It
   inevitably requires understanding the dynamics of platforms and
   ecosystems. These challenges are amplified for enabling technologies,
   which are the central focus of this article. The innovator of an
   enabling technology has a special business model challenge because the
   applicability to many downstream verticals forecloses, as a practical
   matter, ownership of all the relevant complements. Complementary assets
   (vertical and lateral) in the digital context are no longer just
   potential value-capture mechanisms (through asset price appreciation or
   through preventing exposure to monopolistic bottleneck pricing by
   others); they may well be needed simply for the technology to function.
   Technological and innovational complementors present both coordination
   and market design challenges to the innovator that generally lead to
   market failure in the form of an excess of social over private returns.
   The low private return leads to socially sub-optimal underinvestment in
   future R\&D that can be addressed to some extent by better strategic
   decision-making by the innovator and/or by far-sighted policies from
   government and the judiciary.
   The default value-capture mechanism for many enabling technologies is
   the licensing of trade secrets and/or patents. Licensing is shown to be
   a difficult business model to implement from a value-capture
   perspective. When injunctions for intellectual property infringement are
   hard to win, or even to be considered, the incentives for free riding by
   potential licensees are considerable. Licensing is further complicated
   if it involves standard essential patents, as both courts and policy
   makers may fail to understand that development of a standard involves
   components of both interoperability and technology development. If a
   technology standard is not treated as the embodiment of significant R\&D
   efforts enabling substantial new downstream economic activity, then
   rewards are likely to be calibrated too low to support appropriate
   levels of future innovation.}},

Abstract = {{With the increasing importance of the sustainable product development of
   the building materials for the sustainable building and its industries,
   this study structured the existing sustainability assessment methods
   based on a common information structure, which was classified by its
   categories, aspects, and indicators. Sustainability indicator lists were
   structured into 25 categories, 88 aspects which 25\% of those were
   product or product and regional related ones. Most of the sorted
   indicators related to products were difficult to be applied at the early
   phase of product development due to the lack of required level of
   information. Meanwhile, the indicators could be a supportive tool for
   the later phase of product development, for the production planning step
   as an example. Since the regional conditions showed the link between the
   sustainability performance during the building's operational phase, the
   conditions may serve as a proxy information to guide during the earlier
   product development phase. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The circular economy is set to be the future paradigm in business.
   Consumer preferences and demographics changed the way companies design
   products, market them, and interact with their customers. In this
   conceptual article, it is argued that the positive externalities
   documented in the circular economy literature (environmental impact,
   creating of a sustainable economy) can also be translated into a
   financial gain for shareholders. This article focuses on only one aspect
   of this potential multifaceted financial gain: an improvement in the
   customer relationship. The finance-marketing hybrid model of consumer
   life value is used to explain the extent of this possible increase in
   the market equity value of the firm when adopting this new economic
   paradigm.}},

Abstract = {{The reference quality effect is an important factor that influences
   consumer purchasing behavior. To investigate how firms should
   incorporate the reference quality effect under different business
   models, we focus on a supply chain consisting of a supplier and a
   retailer where the retailer can be an offline store, a pure online store
   or a combination of offline and online stores within an offline to
   online model. We formulate the reference quality effect with a modified
   Nerlove-Arrow model and use two different sales functions to reflect the
   fact that the reference quality effect will affect consumers in various
   ways when the business model varies. Utilizing differential game theory,
   the equilibrium decisions of the channel members are derived, and the
   analysis illustrates how the firms should adjust their decisions when
   the retailers use different retail patterns. The basic model does not
   allow product returns, but then this assumption is relaxed. Comparison
   between the two cases shows under what conditions consumers will benefit
   from the retailer's allowing product returns.}},

Journal = {{RENEWABLE ENERGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{125}},
Pages = {{599-608}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Grid integrated water electrolysers have the potential of coupling
   electric power systems subjected to high shares of renewable energy
   sources with sectors of hydrogen demand, thus contributing to European
   decarbonization goals in future. We therefore investigate the business
   potential of future electrolyser applications in cross-commodity
   arbitrage trading by applying a complex power market simulation method
   for future scenarios and different European countries. Based on this, we
   evaluate the potential of additional provision of grid services towards
   grid operators in order to increase the electrolyser utilization ratio.
   For this, we use a method that identifies measures of transmission grid
   operators in order to ensure secure grid operation. In this context,
   uncertain hydrogen prices and different sectors of hydrogen demand are
   addressed through sensitivities of different hydrogen sales prices. The
   analysis shows a high dependency of business model efficiency on the
   hydrogen price. While cross-commodity arbitrage trading can achieve
   profitability for the transportation sector, applications for the
   industry sector and natural gas system are less efficient. The results
   however indicate that for these less efficient applications grid service
   provision can be an option of increasing the electrolyser utilization
   ratio thus increasing its profitability. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published

Abstract = {{Demographic growth that will take place on urban centers for the next
   decades may constitute a new challenge for water providers, which may
   then have to rely on more distant and/or poorer quality sources, or opt
   for energy-intensive technological solutions. In this context, the
   water-energy nexus will assume great relevance in near future water
   management policies and rainwater harvesting systems (RHS) may arise as
   an appealing alternative. The goal of this paper was to describe
   RaINvesT, a holistic tool developed to assess the viability of RHS,
   helping to adequately size the system, while allowing estimating its
   embodied energy per cubic meter (kWh/m(3)). Additionally, considering
   the independence towards the public water supply network, an investment
   analysis is performed for both the water provider and the final user
   perspectives. RaINvesT was tested for a university campus: evidencing,
   in terms of embodied energy, a positive ratio of 0.013 kWh/m(3). The
   investment analysis has proven the RHS to be economically viable,
   revealing an investment return of about 12 years. The promotion of RHS
   can therefore represent a viable business model for water utilities, and
   can be a step forward in water systems decentralization, contributing to
   this sector sustainability for future cities.}},

Journal = {{TELEMATICS AND INFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{35}},

Abstract = {{The rapid spread of ad blockers potentially threatens the sustainability
   of the hitherto dominant business model of ad-supported websites, in
   which users get web content free in return for allowing themselves to be
   exposed to advertising. Focusing on the users' perspective, this study
   proposes that (a) adoption of ad blockers is positively influenced by
   the level of knowledge of their advantageous features; (b) the decision
   to continue using ad blockers is negatively affected by attitude toward
   online advertising; and (c) this attitude is positively shaped by
   perceptions of online advertising's pleasure, credibility, and economic
   benefits, as well as negatively shaped by perceptions of online
   advertising's intrusiveness and clutter. We tested these relationships
   in a survey study among the members of an online panel supported by the
   Spanish advertising industry, and all the relationships were confirmed
   within a structural equation model. Our findings provide some
   implications for online advertising stakeholders. Web publishers and
   online advertisers may expect that, in the coming years, ad blockers
   will continue to spread rapidly as a consequence of the extension of
   their knowledge among Internet users. These stakeholders are thus
   advised to focus on improving Internet users' experiences with online
   advertising by reducing those ad characteristics that provoke negative
   reactions and by strengthening those that are positively evaluated.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past few years, registration figures of plug-in electric
   vehicles have increased rapidly in industrialized countries. This could
   cause considerable mid- to long-term effects on electricity markets. To
   tackle potential challenges specific to electric power systems, we
   develop a load-shift-incentivizing electricity tariff that is suitable
   for electric vehicle users and analyze the tariff scheme in three parts.
   First, acceptance is analyzed based on surveys conducted among fleet
   managers and electric vehicle users. Corresponding results are used to
   calibrate the tariff. Secondly, load flexibilities of electric vehicle
   charging are used in an agent-based electricity market simulation model
   of the French and German wholesale electricity markets to simulate
   corresponding market impacts. Thirdly, the charging manager's
   ('aggregator') business model is analyzed. Our results reveal that the
   tariff is highly suitable for incentivizing vehicle users to provide
   load flexibilities, which consequently increase the contribution margins
   of the charging managers. The main drawback is the potential for
   `avalanche effects' on wholesale electricity markets increasing charging
   mangers' expenditures, especially in France.}},

Abstract = {{The financial sector is facing radical transformation. Leveraging
   digital technologies to offer innovative services, FinTech start-ups are
   emerging in domains such as asset management, lending, or insurance.
   Despite increasing investments, the FinTech phenomenon is low on
   theoretical insights. So far, the offerings of FinTech start-ups have
   been predominantly investigated from a functional perspective. As a
   functional perspective does not suffice to fully understand the
   offerings of FinTech start-ups, we propose a taxonomy of non-functional
   characteristics. Thereby, we restrict our analysis to consumer-oriented
   FinTech start-ups. Our taxonomy includes 15 dimensions structured along
   the perspectives interaction, data, and monetization. We demonstrate the
   applicability of our taxonomy by classifying the offerings of 227
   FinTech start-ups and by identifying archetypes via a cluster analysis.
   Our taxonomy contributes to the descriptive knowledge on FinTech
   start-ups, enabling researchers and practitioners to analyze the service
   offerings of FinTech start-up in a structured manner.}},

Abstract = {{The on-demand economy is built upon company strategies of arbitrage
   between worker autonomy and worker control. Using ethnographic and
   interview data, I show how these strategies undermine the economic
   theory that justifies the on-demand business model. The increased
   freedom and flexibility on offer to workers is countered by softer and
   less visible forms of workforce surveillance and control. These take
   hold through information asymmetries, which narrow workers'
   decision-making capacities and thus undercut arguments for workers'
   designation as independent contractors. However, I also show that these
   forms of control ultimately hinge on workers' willingness to conform to
   the calculative rationalities that companies project onto them, and that
   workers' motivations diverge from these company assumptions. I conclude
   by countering the notion of calculability with that of qualculation, an
   affective style of reasoning that workers employ in response to
   algorithmic workforce management and which highlights how on-the-job
   decisions are made within a shifting moral economy of work.}},

Abstract = {{The move towards a new Circular Economy (CE) economic model has been
   advocated and supported in Portugal, however, there is limited research
   on this topic. To address this gap, a quantitative research based on an
   online survey was carried out among 99 Portuguese organizations,
   encompassing a wide range of sectors and sizes. The results show that CE
   is regarded as a strategic and relevant issue for profitability and
   value creation. Furthermore, the perception that it requires the
   adoption of new business models in addition to the classical ``reduce,
   reuse and recycle{''} approach is growing. Moreover, based on the
   hypotheses raised, results suggest that the level of CE adoption is
   positively impacted by the status of the EMS (Environmental Management
   System) certification and the willingness to improve the environmental
   performance and achieve a sustainable business model. However, CE
   activities are still relatively modest and a friendlier context (fiscal,
   legal, organizational, etc.) and the stronger support from supply chain
   agents and consumers are required. Future research should focus on how
   to design and shape the transition from a linear to a CE economy and to
   ascertain if the positive attitude towards CE is materialized in
   changing the way business is done.}},

Abstract = {{Although most prior literature on the strategic value of corporate
   venture capital (CVC) investments has focused solely on its role as an
   explorative learning method, in reality, many corporate investors are
   also using CVC investments for exploitative learning to strengthen their
   existing business model. In this study, we focus on the operational
   aspects of CVC investments and discuss how the explorative and
   exploitative innovation performance of corporate investors is affected
   by the level of the structural autonomy granted to their CVC dedicated
   unit. Using 20 years of panel data from 77 corporate investors in U.S.
   high-tech industries, we find that the structural autonomy of the CVC
   unit exhibits a positive relationship with the corporate investor's
   explorative innovation performance, while it is negatively related with
   exploitative innovation performance.}},

Abstract = {{The literature on sustainable business models (SBMs) offers different
   classifications of the available kinds of SBM. Our careful reading of
   this literature reveals that the received classifications have developed
   adhoc from multiple divergent perspectives. As a consequence, the
   proposed classifications are only partly overlapping and difficult to
   reconcile, thus hampering cumulative progress. Building on this premise,
   we offer a synthesis and consolidation of the available knowledge about
   SBMs. Following the notion of patterns as problem-solution combinations,
   we developed, tested, and applied a new multi-method and multi-step
   approach centred on an expert review process that combines literature
   review, Delphi survey, and physical card sorting to identify and
   validate the currently existing SBM patterns. Ten international experts
   participated in this process. They classified 45 SBM patterns, assigned
   these patterns to 11 groups along ecological, social, and economic
   dimensions of sustainability and evaluated their potential to contribute
   to value creation. The resulting taxonomy can serve as a basis for more
   unified and comparable studies of SBMs and for new business model tools
   that can be used in various disciplines and industries to analyse and
   develop sustainability-oriented business models in a consistent manner.

Abstract = {{Traditionally, wasted resources are considered a burden that imposes a
   cost on organizations. However, ecological sustainability principles
   underpinning the linked discourses of industrial ecology and the
   Circular Economy conceptualize waste as intrinsically valuable. Our
   research identified exemplar business organizations that had each
   changed their business models to resolve the tension of waste as a
   burden and/or resource. Synthesizing these cases, we found these
   organizations applied systems thinking to reframe their product and
   service offerings and developed material circular flows in their
   business models. Analysis of how our exemplar organizations changed
   their business models to tackle pressing sustainability issues and to
   resolve the burden-resource tension show that the focus of change is on
   reconceptualizing their understanding of the role of waste in the value
   chain of their products and services. This altered understanding of
   waste as a resource across their value networks initiated negotiations
   with their existing suppliers to also modify their supply chain
   practices.}},

Abstract = {{Integrated Reporting (IR) represents the most recent evolution of the
   corporate reporting movement. Despite the proposed benefits to
   stakeholders and the number of contributes aimed at identifying best
   practices in its adoption, IR is still scarcely diffused among companies
   and when it is adopted the framework is not fully implemented. Starting
   from these premises, this paper aims to assess the quality of integrated
   reports issued by firms. We have developed a scoring model and an IR
   Scoreboard (IRS), which were applied to analyze 116 integrated reports
   issued in years 2013 and 2014. The main findings show that IR quality is
   low. Generally, firms follow the IR framework, but scarce information is
   disclosed on aspects such as capital, the business model, strategic
   priorities, and the value creation process; more attention is given to
   the IR form than to its content. Copyright (c) 2018 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{Although research into the business model has received increasing
   attention, few studies have so far been conducted on business model
   innovation in an international context. The purpose of the study is to
   identify different patterns of business model innovation which enables
   international retailers to rebuild their core business logic in new host
   countries. On the basis of comparing and contrasting the business model
   changes of 15 international retailers from various home countries to one
   single host country (China), our study provides an indepth understanding
   of business model innovation in the context of international business.
   By looking at the firms' capabilities in rebuilding their core logic in
   the setting of a host country, we reveal six routes of retail business
   model innovation. Utilizing the lens of organizational learning theory
   and internationalization, we identify three patterns of resource
   deployment by international companies in the process of developing
   business model innovations. Our study, therefore, provides insights and
   guidance for multinational companies in general, international retailers
   in particular, as for how to successfully adapt their business model
   from home country to host country.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the proposition that adopting a socially
   responsible, or philanthropic, management posture is not antithetic to
   the capitalist business model but rather can be seen as a sound approach
   to the development of long-term sustainability in business in a modern
   business environment, wherein a strand of corporate social
   responsibility is one core aspect of the composite utility function of
   the modern business. We suggest further that for many of the
   prominent/significant examples of the successful adoption of a policy of
   informed benevolence in the management of employees that policy seems to
   be faith rooted - be that faith Christian, Buddhist, Jewish, Muslim or
   other. Indeed, even if one observed an organisation subject to an
   humanist or even atheistic based socially responsible management, one
   could see that as being rooted in that organisation's `non-faith' faith,
   or ethical bubble. Our argument also gives the lie to the proposition,
   in currency in some circles, that the term `business ethics' is an
   oxymoron. To underpin the argument we cite examples (/set out
   mini-cases, or a mixture of these) from a range of faith based
   traditions including, Buddhism, the Quaker-Christian tradition, Judaism
   and Islam.}},

   Force Mediterranean (EUNAVFOR MED) Operation Sophia, the naval and air
   force intervention deployed by the EU in the Central Southern
   Mediterranean to disrupt the business model of human smuggling and
   trafficking while protecting life at sea. We look at the
   military-humanitarian mode of migration management that this operation
   performs from three vantage points: logistics, with a focus on the
   infrastructure of migrant travels; subjectivity, looking at the migrant
   profiles this operation works through; and epistemology, building on the
   mission's first stage of intelligence and data gathering. Through this
   multi-focal approach, we illuminate the productivity of this
   military-humanitarian approach to the migration crisis in the

Abstract = {{We study threshold discounting, or the practice of offering a
   discounted-price service if at least a prespecified number of customers
   signal interest in it, as pioneered by Groupon. We model a
   capacity-constrained firm, a random-sized population of strategic
   customers, a desirable hot period, and a less desirable slow period.
   Compared to a more traditional approach (slow period discounting or
   closure), threshold discounting has two operational advantages. First,
   the contingent discount temporally balances demand when the market for
   the service is large, and reduces supply of the service (preserving
   higher margins) when the market is small, allowing the firm to respond
   to the service's unobserved market potential. Second, activation of the
   threshold discount signals the market state and the consequent service
   availability to strategic customers, inducing them into self-selecting
   the consumption period to one that improves the firm's capacity
   utilization. Yet, threshold discounting can be harmful in situations
   with chronically low demand. In contrast with past work on strategic
   customers, their presence is advantageous to firms in our context. A
   calibrated numerical study shows that threshold discounting improves
   firm profits over a traditional approach by as much as 33\% (7\% on
   average).}},

   Application}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The purpose of this study is to examine the efficiency of the banks in
   Lithuania by employing the DEA method and evaluate bank performance in a
   low interest rate environment. The efficiency scores were calculated
   with a non-parametric frontier input-oriented DEA technique with the
   variable returns to scale (VRS) and the constant returns to scale (CRS)
   assumptions. Five alternative models with different input-output
   combinations were developed, based on production, profitability and
   intermediation dimensions. The main bank profitability measure-the
   return on assets (ROA) ratio-was employed to validate the results
   obtained using the DEA method. The Lithuanian bank's efficiency analysis
   based on the VRS assumption shows that better results are demonstrated
   by the local banks. The technical efficiency analysis based on the CRS
   assumption shows other results: the banks owned by the Nordic parent
   group and the branches have higher pure efficiency than local banks and
   have success at working at the right scale. Based on this, it stated
   that during the 2012-2016 period the larger Lithuanian banks
   (subsidiaries) applied a more appropriate business model than smaller
   (local) banks operating in Lithuania. Additionally, this research
   contributes to the scholarly literature in the field of determinants of
   bank business performance in concentrated markets dominated by foreign
   banks and, in particular, from one region.}},

Title = {{Sustainability assessment of retail logistics solutions using external
   costs analysis: a case-study for the city of Antwerp}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN TRANSPORT RESEARCH REVIEW}},

Abstract = {{Policy implementation in the logistics sector might drive unexpected
   side-effects which sometimes undermine the performance of key economic
   activities of logistics operators, especially in areas such as transport
   service, sustainability of operations, etc. Especially for the latter,
   there is a lack of understanding how the sustainability performance if
   retail logistics solutions is impacted on by policy implementation and,
   in turn, by operators' responsive measures. This paper conducts a
   sustainability analysis of concrete innovative and already tested retail
   logistics solutions addressing the research question ``what are the
   effects of retail logistics solutions on total costs and sustainability
   performance?{''}
   The analysis relies on the development and application of an
   indicator-based framework based on the key sustainability components
   (economy, environment, society) and enriched by the addition of the
   transport component. The framework assesses three different scenarios
   together with a business-as-is one: Urban Consolidation Centre,
   Tethering and Shared Bus accompanied with a Strengths-Weaknesses
   analysis. Data are provided by an international food retailer operating
   within the city of Antwerp, Belgium, but conclusions can be generalized
   due to wider applicability of measures and solutions examined.
   External costs analysis shows that higher degree of internalization is
   achieved in the line-haul transport. Within an urban context, the
   measures that do not require significant initial investment and broad
   interventions are assessed as the most sustainable in our analysis.
   Tethering is the solution that indicates the highest sustainability
   score.
   The impact of innovative and already tested solutions relies on a
   variety of factors: organizational, urban context, type of goods
   transported, engagement of stakeholders, etc.. In any case, innovation
   is crucial for urban retail logistics impacting on transport service,
   society, economy and environment. Any new retail business model should
   be designed with respect to cost efficiency and through a socially
   acceptable transition path.}},

Abstract = {{Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (SpaceX) had demonstrated its
   reusable launch vehicle technology by recovering and reusing the core
   stage of its Falcon 9 launch vehicles. SpaceX believes reusable launch
   vehicles will enable its vision of colonizing Mars. This had unleashed
   pricing competition as SpaceX had begun offering low-cost access to
   space. Rival launch service providers, although contentious of SpaceX
   business model, are planning to introduce reusable launch systems into
   their product mix. This article offers a survey of such launch service
   providers from 4 distinct geographical regions with varying degrees of
   public-to-private ownership and catering to different requirements. The
   study conveys that regardless of these variables, reusability is fast
   becoming the norm of the launch vehicle industry. Interestingly,
   managers of these programs do not shy from admitting that Elon Musk and
   SpaceX are influential factors in their decision-making. The article
   argues that the space industry is witnessing a major disruption guided
   by innovation and determination to take bold risks. The core argument is
   that even though SpaceX is yet to prove its business model, perhaps the
   real effect of it is not in making profits but in leading a permanent
   change in the space industry.}},

Abstract = {{Research Summary: While it has long been recognized that the business
   model can be a source of performance heterogeneity, less is known about
   how the business model affects consumers' perceptions about a firm's
   products and services. By taking a demand-side perspective, I argue that
   business models create and capture value when the elements that compose
   a business model improve how consumers perceive a firm's products and
   better enable heterogeneous consumers to act on their
   willingness-to-pay. I develop theory on how the freemium business model
   competes with the premium business model and test hypotheses in the
   market for digital PC games. Results show that freemium games are played
   less and generate less revenues and that greater variety in games' menus
   of paid items is associated with higher revenues. Managerial Summary:
   Freemium business models are increasingly prevalent in the digital
   economy, yet very little is known about how freemium affects consumers'
   perceptions of value and their willingness-to-pay. In this article, I
   study how the freemium business model competes with the premium business
   model in the market for digital PC games. Results show that freemium
   games are played less and generate less revenues than premium games and
   that greater variety in games' menus of paid items is associated with
   higher revenues. This implies that in order to achieve competitive
   parity with firms operating the premium business model, firms operating
   the freemium business model need to create more value (e.g., through
   improved product quality, income from advertisements, or unlocking
   network externalities) or operate at lower costs.}},

Abstract = {{Business model innovation is increasingly seen as a means to promote
   sustainable forms of production and consumption, having been linked to
   technological innovations in electric vehicles and the circular economy.
   Business models are an organisational phenomenon that concern focal
   firms and their networks. However, there is no theory of the firm in
   transition theory, such that the role of business model innovation in
   wider transformative processes is unclear. This paper aims to redress
   this issue by combining a business model perspective with core concepts
   and constructs from transition theory. We elucidate sources of change
   and inertia that issue from new and existing business models,
   illustrating our arguments by focusing on mobility services, which have
   the potential to radically transform road transportation via new
   business models. We derive new lines of inquiry that can be used to

Title = {{Business models for commercial scale second-generation bioethanol
   production}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},

Abstract = {{Faced with the prospect of depletion of non-renewable sources of fossil
   fuels and concerns about the emission of substances that compromise the
   environment, biofuels, and especially bioethanol, have attracted the
   attention of researchers, companies and governments. Specifically, the
   second generation of bioethanol has critical stages in the production
   process which have been limiting for companies to achieve production on
   a commercial scale. Although research has sought to overcome such
   constraints by focusing on technological challenges, it has been
   recognized that the greater or lesser absorption capacity of
   technological innovations is related to the business model used. The
   purpose of this article was to analyze the business models used by
   Brazilian companies that have achieved commercial scale production of
   second generation bioethanol, studying their business models as
   commercial viability instruments of technologies, looking to subsidize
   companies of this segment in formulating their policies to reach
   commercial scale. The research was carried out through a methodology
   based on the content analysis technique, which provided the following
   categories that served as the basis for the analysis of the business
   models: company focus, raw material, costs, certification, technology
   and production. Among the six major second-generation commercial ethanol
   plants in the world - GranBio, Raizen, Poet-DSM, BetaRenewables, Abengoa
   (plant bought by Synata Bio) and DuPont - two are Brazilian: GranBio and
   Raizen, which mainly use sugar cane bagasse and straw as raw material.
   The study demonstrated that both companies have competitive advantages
   that are equivalent in most of the categories studied, albeit GranBio's
   business model performs better in some other categories due to the
   strategic partnerships it has established with some of the main
   companies in the segment, thus, better exploring the benefits of the
   open innovation environment that characterizes the competitive arena.

Abstract = {{Networking in Internet of Things (IoT) has had an immeasurable impact on
   the existing business models. In this context, exploring the hotspots
   and trends of business model innovation has become particularly
   necessary. For the topic literature over the past 20 years retrieved
   from Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index
   databases, scientometrics with information visualization technology was
   used to carry on the knowledge mapping with the following indicator: the
   co-cited reference networks, reference bursts, keyword bursts, and
   keyword co-occurrence networks. The results show (1) ``e-commerce,{''}
   ``open source,{''} ``performance,{''} ``entrepreneurship,{''} etc. are
   the main hotpots, and ``value creation,{''} ``open innovation,{''}
   ``small business,{''} ``networks,{''} etc. are the new hotpots; (2) the
   trends of hotspots transited from early ``information technology{''} to
   later ``self-service,{''} ``mass customization,{''} and
   ``biotechnology{''} and to present ``cloud manufacturing,{''}
   ``telemedicine,{''} ``climate change,{''} and ``sustainable
   development,{''}. etc.; (3) ``intelligent robot,{''} ``3D printing,{''}
   and the methodology of business mode innovation may be the future
   hotspots. This is the first paper visualizing the hotspots and emerging
   trends of business model innovation specially through scientometrics
   from a global perspective.}},

Title = {{Financial performance of servitized manufacturing firms: A configuration
   issue between servitization strategies and customer-oriented
   organizational design}},
Journal = {{INDUSTRIAL MARKETING MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{71}},
Pages = {{54-68}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The literature posits a positive relationship between servitization and
   financial performance. However, empirical evidence is inconclusive and
   notes the enabling role of organization. To contribute to this topic,
   this work first advocates for a new approach to define the servitization
   strategy of manufacturing firms based on the nature of their offerings
   and their impact on the provider-customer relationships. Three
   categories of strategy are suggested: added services-AS, activities
   reconfiguration-AR, and business model reconfiguration-BMR. Then, a
   general framework posits that financial performance stems from the
   adoption of specific COOD configurations depending on the servitization
   strategy adopted. Three dimensions of COOD are considered: service
   culture-SC, customer interface-CI and service delivery system-SDS. Based
   on a study involving 184 manufacturing firms, the research model
   provides quantitative support for driver configurations that increase
   financial performance. The results from both structural equation models
   and qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) confirm that all
   servitization strategies can lead to increased performance, but only
   with specific COOD configurations. The findings provide stimulating
   managerial implications: a company implementing an AS strategy has no
   incentive to invest in a complex COOD; firms adopting an AR strategy
   should focus largely on their SDS; and firms choosing a BMR strategy
   must develop a robust SC.}},

Abstract = {{Business Model (BM) Innovations aim at making systemic changes in the
   business logic of companies when they are bringing innovative products
   and services to the market. Companies should be sensitive to changes in
   their business environment and able to modify their BMs in an agile way.
   To assess the agility of BMI during specific market entry situations,
   this paper uses a method that stress tests the value proposition and the
   components of a BM against contingent uncertainties. We present three
   qualitative case studies of companies that differ in their market entry
   approach. Starting from their strategic orientation, these case
   companies' stress test their Business models and BM components, using a
   scenario-based identification of uncertainties. The BM Stress Test
   method contributes to a quick understanding of the components their BM
   needs to monitor, reconsider, or improve. Such stress testing helps
   enhance business agility. The research contributes to market strategy
   and business modelling research by introducing BM Stress Testing as a
   new method that can achieve and maintain agility regarding BM
   uncertainties.}},

Abstract = {{A number of studies have placed at the forefront variables that predict
   the loyalty of clients in fitness centres. In fact, no study has
   analysed the differences between these variables according to business
   models. The objective of this study was to analyse the relationship
   between quality, value, satisfaction and the future intentions of
   clients of public and private low-cost fitness centres and their
   differences. A questionnaire was administered to a sample of 1805
   fitness centre clients. A confirmatory factor analysis and multi-group
   analysis was performed to test the difference between two invariance
   models. The findings indicate a greater weight in facilities and
   employees of the quality perceived from private low-cost fitness centres
   and a greater weight in programmes from public fitness centres.
   Furthermore, the relationship between the variables' overall quality,
   perceived value, satisfaction and future intentions had a greater
   influence in private low-cost fitness centres than in public centres.}},

   experiences, and wider practitioner and policy lessons from a circular
   economy business model over a 30-year period, highlighting the
   successes, difficulties, and conflicts of adopting a circular economy
   model. The case is based on interviews, key documents, and customer
   insight. The findings demonstrate how sustained circular economy
   business practices can deliver significant new revenues, resource
   productivity, and business continuity benefits, but also require
   managers and practitioners to develop competencies and capabilities,
   such as balancing linear and circular systems, to address complex and
   highly dynamic factors, including rapid technological shifts and market
   volatility.}},

Title = {{Designing Business Solutions for Plastic Waste Management to Enhance
   Circular Transitions in Kenya}},
Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Least-developed countries face many challenges regarding their plastic
   waste management systems. In 2017, Kenya imposed a selective ban
   targeting manufacturers and consumers of plastic carrier bags. However,
   this selectivity does not avoid the continuous use of other plastic
   products. The present paper states that circular priorities, which have
   been defined to advanced economies, would not be entirely valid for the
   rest of the world. While high-income countries face only the impacts of
   their own consumption, developing nations must endure the externalities
   of these developed economies. Thus, the focus of the least developed
   part of the world must not be on reducing its relatively normal (or even
   low) consumption, but to manage its surplus material flow. According to
   the employed circular evaluation methodology (CEV-Circular Economic
   Value), the circularity level in Kenya's plastic material flow stands on
   a rather low stage with 32.72\%. This result outlines the linear
   deficiencies of the plastic waste management system and urges the
   prevention of further material leakage (such as energy use). Through the
   Business Model Canvas (BMC) approach this study offers a holistic
   business solution which can improve the system's sustainability.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to discuss the features of leasing as a
   business model in the circular economy, which is presumed to support
   sustainable development by product recirculation and driving economic
   performance. In particular, this study highlights microeconomic benefits
   for listed Romanian companies, showing that adopting a ``greener{''}
   business model, as in the case of leasing, does not penalize firms
   economically but it is a catalyst for increasing their performance, both
   in terms of accountancy-based measures (return on assets and return on
   sales), but also in terms of the subjective perceptions of investors and
   financial analysts operating on the capital market (proxied by Tobin's Q
   and market to book value of equity). Based on 266 observations from
   companies listed on the Bucharest Stock Exchange (BSE) during 2013-2016,
   the study uses regression analysis to show that financial performance is
   higher for quoted Romanian companies that use leasing and renting and
   that performance is also directly associated with leasing intensity,
   i.e. the share of the value of the rights to use leased goods in the
   total value of property, plant and equipment.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes two effects caused by ``channel conflict{''}, which
   occurs when firms newly add a direct online channel via the Internet or
   a mobile device. The first is an ``intra-cannibalization effect{''}
   between the firms' existing retail channel and the new online channel,
   and the second is the ``inter-competition effect{''} between
   manufacturers and retailers in the supply chain. In particular, this
   paper investigates a manufacturer's retailing channel strategy
   considering the relative market power between a manufacturer and a
   retailer in the supply chain, which has been rarely considered in
   previous studies.
   This paper shows the manufacturer's channel strategies: (i) if customers
   are very heterogeneous with regard to their receptiveness to online
   shopping, the manufacturer may use a multi-channel strategy. (ii) if the
   customer sector becomes homogeneous, the manufacturer will become more
   willing to adopt an omni-channel strategy. (iii) if customers are
   neither similar nor very different, the manufacturer uses a
   brick-and-mortar strategy. This paper also shows results on the issue of
   channel conflict in terms of market power: (i) the retailer may
   voluntarily limit its market power and thus, self-created competition in
   the retail market alleviates the problem of double-markup to some
   extent. (ii) the manufacturer can use an online channel when
   inter-competition effect becomes severe. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Carsharing provides an alternative to private car ownership by allowing
   car use temporarily on an on-demand basis. Operators provide carsharing
   services using different business models and ownership structures. We
   distinguish between cooperative, business-to-consumer (B2C) roundtrip
   and one-way, as well as peer-to-peer (P2P) carsharing. This paper
   characterizes these different types of business models and compares
   their success in terms of diffusion using a comprehensive database of
   all 101 German carsharing providers in 2016. The key result holds that
   fleet size is significantly different across business models ranging
   from a few cars (cooperatives in small towns), to a few hundred (B2C
   roundtrip in larger cities), to over a thousand (B2C one-way in largest
   cities), up to multiple thousands (P2P across the country). By analyzing
   for each operator the number of cars per capita in the city they operate
   in, we do not find significant differences across business models
   indicating the viability of each separate business model type. Hence, we
   conclude that business models will continue to co-exist for a while,
   although some of the business models may well converge in the longer run
   due to Internet-of-Things applications and the introduction of
   self-driving cars.}},

Abstract = {{Disruptive technologies can increase the intelligence of goods and
   revitalize business models in the circular economy. Applying an
   industrial ecology perspective, this article discusses how intelligent
   goods can boost the sustainability of industrial ecosystems. North
   American and European cases highlight how business model innovators can
   utilize goods-related information to develop more competitive
   closed-loop systems. The authors identify three archetypes of
   closed-loop systems-inner circles, decentralized systems, and open
   systems-and delineate how they leverage information resources for
   collaboration. This study advances the understanding of closed-loop
   systems in the circular economy, which is more dependent than ever on

Abstract = {{Since the emergence of the Internet, many brick-and-mortar companies
   from various industries have established an online business model (BM)
   alongside their traditional offline BM. Despite the increasing
   coexistence of online and offline BMs within a single company, however,
   most prior research has focused on studying online and offline BMs in
   isolation. Consequently, still little is known about the interplay of
   dual BMs in omnichannel businesses. We address this research gap through
   an empirical investigation of the synergies and tensions that arise from
   coexisting online and offline BMs as well as the factors that influence
   the emergence of such synergies and tensions. Drawing on a series of six
   case studies with three publishers and three retailers, we identify an
   extended set of BM synergies and tensions, which concern all major BM
   dimensions. In addition, our case analysis reveals that companies are
   able to exploit different synergies, but also face different tensions
   between their online and offline BMs. The observed differences can be
   traced back to the level of online-offline BM integration,
   online-offline product distinctions (e.g., in terms of product content
   and publication cycles), and general organization context factors (e.g.,
   offline brand strength, organization structure). By uncovering both the
   benefits and the complexity of running online and offline BMs in
   parallel, our study contributes to the theoretical understanding of
   omnichannel businesses, and provides managers with practical guidance on
   how to design, integrate, and manage their dual BMs successfully. (C)

Abstract = {{A Dynamic Manufacturing Network (DMN) is the manufacturing industry
   application of the Virtual Enterprise (VE) business model based on real
   time information sharing and process integration. DMNs are normally
   formed and supported by a collaborative platform previously designed and
   built by a preexisting strategic partnership. The collaborative platform
   forms and tracks each DMN through all phases of its life cycle which
   leads to the accumulation and storage of large historical datasets on
   partner and customer characteristics and actions. This data holds the
   key to customer and manufacturer behavioral patterns and performances
   that can further be used in the decision making processes.
   In this study, we have focused on tackling this widely neglected
   research opportunity, by integrating manufacturer, order and customer
   data and characteristics into DMN formation and planning. The developed
   big data analytics approach consists of TOPSIS, fuzzy inference system
   and multi objective optimization techniques. Initially, by integrating
   the TOPSIS multi criteria decision making technique with a fuzzy
   inference system (FIS) we have computed indices for Manufacturer
   reliability and Order priority. Then we developed a multi-objective
   mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model to generate efficient
   solutions minimizing cost and assigning more reliable manufacturers to
   orders with higher priority. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Data is a modem form of wealth in the digital world, and massive amounts
   of data circulate in cloud environments. While this enormously
   facilitates the sharing of information, both for personal and
   professional purposes, it also introduces some critical problems
   concerning the ownership of the information. Data is an intangible good
   that is stored in large data warehouses, where the hardware
   architectures and software programs running the cloud services coexist
   with the data of many users. This context calls for a twofold
   protection: on one side, the cloud is made up of hardware and software
   that constitute the business assets of the service provider (property of
   the cloud); on the other side, there is a definite need to ensure that
   users retain control over their data (property in the cloud). The law
   grants protection to both sides under several perspectives, but the
   result is a complex mix of interwoven regimes, further complicated by
   the intrinsically international nature of cloud computing that clashes
   with the typical diversity of national laws. As the business model based
   on cloud computing grows, public bodies, and in particular the European
   Union, are striving to find solutions to properly regulate the future
   economy, either by introducing new laws, or by finding the best ways to
   apply existing principles. (C) 2017 Cesare Bartolini, Cristiana Santos

Abstract = {{The significant increase of municipal solid wastes (e.g., food
   disposals, biomedical wastes, recyclable materials, etc.) is a very
   important environmental issue around the world. Waste recycling,
   reduction, and reuse are not only methods to solve environmental
   problems, but also directions for social innovation for business to
   create potential social value. This study investigates the business
   models of two waste recycling companies in Thailand and Taiwan. First,
   the basic micro and macro environmental factors were analyzed, including
   the period of firm's business operations, location of the firm, space
   for separating and storing recyclable waste and various types of
   recyclable waste purchasing affecting the firms' performance in these
   two economies. Second, different recyclable waste materials, volumes and
   price strategies between the case companies were compared. Third, this
   study also investigates the impacts of factors regarding resource
   characteristics, a firm's capabilities and an entrepreneur's abilities
   to improve a firm's performance all compose a critical business model.
   The results showed that there were an increasing number of owners of
   waste recycling businesses developing and adapting to new business
   models. Detailed comparisons are reported and discussed in the article
   to shed light on managerial and policy implications.}},

Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},

Abstract = {{This study analyzes the ideal strategic trajectory for sustainable and
   traditional product innovation. Using a sample of 74 Costa Rican
   high-performance businesses for 2016, we employ fuzzy set analysis
   (qualitative comparative analysis) to evaluate how the development of
   sustainable and traditional product innovation strategies is conditioned
   by the business' learning capabilities and entrepreneurial orientation
   in knowledge-intensive (KIBS) and non-knowledge-intensive businesses.
   The results indicate two ideal strategic configurations of product
   innovation. The first strategic configuration to reach maximum product
   innovation requires the presence of KIBS firms that have both an
   entrepreneurial and learning orientation, while the second configuration
   is specific to non-KIBS firms with greater firm size and age along with
   entrepreneurial and learning orientation. KIBS firms are found to
   leverage the knowledge-based and customer orientations that characterize
   their business model in order to compensate for the shortage of
   important organizational characteristics-which we link to liabilities or
   smallness and newness-required to achieve optimal sustainable and
   traditional product innovation.}},

Abstract = {{The study examines a case of how the South African construction industry
   nurtured an entrepreneur and a large successful entrepreneurial
   construction company, even though the founder had no formal education
   and the company was founded during the Apartheid era. The question of
   whether entrepreneurs are born or are made is based on the age-old
   question of nurture or nature. The paper presents the narratives of the
   successful entrepreneur Mr. Sam Lubbe and the business strategy he used
   in growing a sustainable business. The information presented is
   collected through a case study research approach. The data collected
   suggests that although Sam does not have any formal education, he
   succeeded based on the nurturing given to him when he had the
   opportunity to work for a large South African construction company, his
   innate characteristics of self-confidence, task-result orientation, and
   originality, as well as his planning for the future and the use of a
   unique business model which helped him access international construction
   work opportunities. The study of this particular individual and his
   unique company is significant because it further validates previous
   research undertaken in other contexts and sectors on the traits of
   entrepreneurs and the success of companies.}},

Title = {{Bridging the gap between feedstock growers and users: the study of a
   coppice poplar-based biorefinery}},
Journal = {{BIOTECHNOLOGY FOR BIOFUELS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{MAR 22}},
Abstract = {{Background: In the biofuel industry, land productivity is important to
   feedstock growers and conversion process product yield is important to
   the biorefinery. The crop productivity, however, may not positively
   correlate with bio-conversion yield. Therefore, it is important to
   evaluate sugar yield and biomass productivity. In this study, 2-year-old
   poplar trees harvested in the first coppice cycle, including one
   low-productivity hybrid and one high-productivity hybrid, were collected
   from two poplar tree farms. Through steam pretreatment and enzymatic
   hydrolysis, the bio-conversion yields of low-and high-productivity
   poplar hybrids were compared for both sites.
   Results: The low-productivity hybrids had 9-19\% higher sugar yields
   than the high-productivity hybrids, although they have the similar
   chemical composition. Economic calculations show the impact on the
   plantation and biorefinery of using the two feedstocks. Growing a
   high-productivity hybrid means the land owner would use 11-26\% less
   land (which could be used for other crops) or collect \$2.53-\$3.46
   MM/year extra revenue from the surplus feedstock. On the other side, the
   biorefinery would receive 5-10\% additional revenue using the
   low-productivity hybrid.
   Conclusion: We propose a business model based on the integration of the
   plantation and the biorefinery. In this model, different feedstocks are
   assessed using a metric of product tonnage per unit land per year. Use
   of this new economic metric bridges the gap between feedstock growers
   and users to maximize the overall production efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Online social networks (OSNs) have become popular and widely used by
   many people nowadays. As those OSNs increase, the virtual social
   interactions have resulted in increasing privacy and security concern.
   Many approaches have been proposed in order to provide users with
   ``better{''} privacy protection, but none of those approaches have
   ``fully succeeded,{''} due to their conflict with service providers'
   economic benefits or due to the suggestion of changing the OSNs
   architecture. In this paper, we propose a new model that would improve
   privacy and security in OSNs by preventing users from revealing private
   and or confidential information online as possible. We endeavor to
   create a balance between privacy and security improvement versus the
   service provider business model.}},

Abstract = {{The consolidation of the biorefinery concept has the potential to
   contribute to the sustainable development of agro-industrial regions,
   particularly in developing countries. The industrial symbiosis (IS)
   approach can leverage this potential through industrial cooperation,
   fostering new businesses, innovation and job creation coupled with
   reduced environmental impacts. We argue that coupling the biorefinery
   concept and the IS approach would invigorate traditionally agricultural
   regions, relying on endogenous vocation to promote sustainability. The
   purpose of this study is to examine the potential for development of an
   agro-industrial symbiosis network (ISN) from the construction of a
   biorefinery in the Norte Fluminense region (Brazil) - a region that has
   become highly dependent on oil \& gas revenues but still has a tradition
   in agriculture and agro-industry. In this paper, we present the scenario
   analysis performed to design the agro ISN and an initial quantification
   of potential benefits. Four scenarios were developed (reference, short,
   mid and long terms) with the support of a synergy matrix and material
   flow analysis. Eighteen waste streams were identified and sixteen were
   addressed through the scenarios. In the long-term scenario, 14
   productive activities could compose the agro-industrial symbiosis
   network, 8 of them as newcomers. ``Quick-wins{''} were identified as
   residues in the reference scenario (CO2, fusel oil and used yeast) that
   could be absorbed by industries currently operating in the region. The
   emission of respectively 350 thousand and 55 thousand tonnes per year of
   solid waste and CO2 would be avoided in the long term. Also, the
   production of succinic acid would provide additional revenue of at least
   US\$19 per tonne of bagasse, adding higher value to the feedstock in
   comparison to electricity production. This study can prompt current
   recycling regulation towards multi-sectorial arrangements, which can
   better contribute to regional resilience than the single-sector reverse
   logistics' arrangements that became recently mandatory with the National
   Policy on Solid Waste. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A stream of literature is emerging where network development and
   business modeling intersect. Various authors emphasize that networks
   influence business models. This paper extends this stream of literature
   by studying two cases in which we analyze how business modeling and
   networking interact over time. We propose the concept `value shaping' to
   describe this interaction. Value shaping refers to the mutually
   constitutive process in which on the one hand networking helps to refine
   and improve the overall business model and on the other hand an improved
   business model spurs expansion of the network. We identify five
   micro-level processes through which value shaping occurs. Value shaping
   is particularly relevant for sustainability-oriented innovations, to
   help clarify all the types of financial, social and environmental value
   to which a business model may contribute. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Food waste is major problem in developed countries, with the latest
   studies pointing to one third of the food produced worldwide. This
   problem occurs throughout the food value stream and has economic,
   environmental and social consequences. This study focuses on a solution
   developed in Portugal for a specific type of waste, vegetables and
   fruits discarded by farmers due to aesthetic reasons. Although with the
   same quality, their appearance is not within the requirements set by the
   main retailers and therefore not commercialized and consumed. The
   project developed to tackle this problem is a non-profit co-op, called
   Fruta Feia (Ugly Fruit) that commercializes this type of products that
   farmers cannot sell through the conventional channels. Tested
   successfully in Lisbon region, is now being replicated in Porto region.
   This study aims at assessing the sustainability of this project and its
   business model regarding the three pillars of sustainability - economic,
   environmental and social. For this, Life Cycle Assessment, investment
   appraisal, Social-Life Cycle Assessment and Social Return on Investment
   methods are used and compared, aiming also at the discussion of the key
   success factors of Fruta Feia project. Results showed not only the
   sustainability of the project, but also the suitability of the methods
   applied to assess the sustainability of a business model. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{This research is based on an algorithm developed for the American stock
   market for increasing the efficiency of closed funds, which had as
   secondary output a suitable and sustainable model that could be
   partially scaled to fit issues regarding automated decision making at
   government level, similar to a basic Business Intelligence solution
   (follows similar procedures like the workflow of IBM Cognos), which
   offers a solution in cutting to best suitable path for making a
   governmental decision, e.g.: if a country needs investment in roads
   infrastructure, healthcare or education, by using the principles behind
   this simple model you could yield the results and come to the best
   solution or best fitted regarding the global economic output.
   The model is based on companies traded on NASDAQ and LSE because they
   offer the best suitable cases for transparency, credible auditing and
   also it emulates the economic sectors that form a nationwide economy.
   The synergy between Big Data analysis, BI practices and processing power
   could lead to new business designed by investment banks and complex
   software developers: the business of automated decision making to reduce
   the paths that could be followed in developing a country or a private
   investment. In the following paper we highlight an update developed on a
   research started almost 7 years ago which developed into a fully

Abstract = {{In this paper, natural convection of air in solar air heaters with
   rectangular, triangular and elliptical fins is numerically investigated.
   Finite volume method is used to discretize the governing equations in
   the three dimensional domain, the Realizable K-epsilon model is used for
   closing the turbulence equations and Business model is utilized for
   simulating buoyancy force. Effect of inclination angle on mass flow rate
   and thermal performance of solar air heaters is studied. The results
   showed that Optimum angles to obtain the highest mass flow rate occur in
   the range of 45 < beta < 60 degrees for triangular and elliptical fins
   and 50 degrees < beta < 75 degrees for rectangular fins. Also the
   reverse flow angle of inclination, beyond which the solar air heater is
   not able to deliver hot air is obtained for different fin shapes. The
   results showed that rectangular fin lead to the narrowest range of
   applicable inclination angles (45 degrees < beta < 90 degrees)and the
   widest range belongs to the elliptical fins with the range of 33.75
   degrees < beta < 90 degrees. Results revealed that the solar air heater
   with rectangular fins has the best thermal performance and yet the
   lowest mass flow rate. Also the results revealed that thermal
   performance of solar air heaters with rectangular fins is slightly
   higher than that of heaters containing two other fin shapes in the same
   dimensions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Circular Economy (CE) gained significant traction in business and
   academia. While in the building sector issues around energy efficiency
   are being widely explored, CE is still a relatively new topic. This
   article reports on three CE pilots in the Dutch building sector and
   develops a collaboration tool for developing and operating circular
   buildings and their supply chain collaborations. First, a conceptual
   framework is developed to study supply chain collaboration in circular
   buildings, which uses theoretical building blocks for visions, actor
   learning, network dynamics and business model innovation. Second, a case
   study is presented where the framework is applied to three cases using
   semi-structured interviews and document analysis. Third, an
   empirically-based tool is developed to enhance collaboration for CE in
   the building sector. The cases include a newly built project, a
   renovation project and a demolition project. It was found that
   developing circular buildings requires (i) a new process design where a
   variety of disciplines in the supply chain is integrated upfront, (ii)
   the co-creation of an ambitious vision, (iii) extension of
   responsibilities to actors along the entire building supply chain, and
   (iv) new business and ownership models. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Mobile devices and social media have led to a profound revolution of
   modern society, obliging many companies to reorient their sales systems
   towards more successful commercial formats (mobile commerce and social
   commerce). The mobile payment, for instance, as an emerging and
   supplementary service to these new commercial formats, is now undergoing
   the adoption process. Mobile payment has long been discussed, but it has
   not yet reached the usage levels expected by the different mass market
   players (financial institutions, telephone operators, etc.) in Western
   societies. The purpose of this paper is to analyze users' acceptance of
   mobile payment systems on social networks. In order to explain
   acceptance, we have integrated trust and perceived risk into the
   traditional TAM model. To complete this study, we have established the
   decisive factors of this payment system by analyzing user's gender, age
   and experience level. The study was conducted through an online survey
   among a national panel composed by 2.012 social network users. The
   results of this research support previous studies and provide
   alternatives for companies to consolidate this new business model by
   means of the new technical developments.}},

   dual challenge for companies: 1) the electricity generation mix
   decision; and 2) their future access to and cost of capital. This
   research focuses on the role that investors have in developing new more
   sustainable generation mix models. Five semi-structured interviews were
   conducted with investors working at a major European asset manager
   company. The interviewees highlighted the integration of renewable
   technologies as a key challenge to the viability of the utilities in the
   future. Other key challenges included a rising carbon price, greater
   decoupling of energy use and GDP growth, policy constraints and
   uncertain regulatory frameworks, lack of relevant core competencies to
   innovate in their business models, the integration of renewable energy
   into their own generation mixes and the grid, the role of new
   technologies, and a lack of urgency from top management. The findings
   indicate that investors play a key role in shaping electricity
   generation mixes, where the principal, agents, and clients must be
   willing to develop and adopt more sustainable generation mix models.}},

Abstract = {{For the attention-based view, the origins of the ideas behind a great
   strategy are less important than the ability of the organization to
   sustain focused attention in developing, implementing, and elaborating
   good ideas into a distinctive strategic agenda for value creation. We
   propose that the transformation of ideas into a great strategy is shaped
   by the firm's identity and corresponding patterns of organizational
   attention. Furthermore, great strategies focus attention on creating
   value for the customer-through the firm's value proposition and business
   model-relative to capturing value for the shareholders. Finally, we
   propose that great strategies emerge from a focused, strategic agenda
   communicated and distributed throughout the organization. We illustrate
   our propositions by comparing Apple and Motorola, which began with
   similar ideas for developing a strategy for seamless integration and
   seamless mobility, with smartphones as the digital hub. Apple sustained
   focused attention on transforming the ideas into the great strategy and
   business model behind the iPhone, while Motorola did not focus or
   sustain attention throughout the organization on developing its original
   ideas, leading to strategic failure.}},

Abstract = {{In many entrepreneurial projects, the concept of the business model (BM)
   is used to describe a business idea at a high-level and in a holistic
   way. However, existing literature pays less attention to implementation
   (or execution) of BM. Implementation becomes more complex when a BM is
   proposed by or requires a network of collaborating enterprises. The aim
   of this paper is to provide an approach based on empirical research that
   supports BM transition from design to implementation. The empirical data
   used in this paper is based on a case study involving an innovative
   project in the pharmaceutical sector in Finland. The case analysis
   demonstrates how a high-level BM needs careful consideration of its
   operational components from a network perspective to secure both value
   creation and capture. Drawing on the analysis, six concluding
   propositions on BM implementation in networked settings are put forward.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims to investigate the applicability of social life cycle
   assessment (SLCA) to the social impacts analysis of product-service
   systems (PSS). The purpose is to discuss the main challenges for this
   approach to comparing PSS business model alternatives and analyzing the
   social consequences of PSS introduction into the market.
   Two PSS solutions were considered to investigate the applicability and
   the challenges for SLCA when applied to PSS assessment. A comparative
   analysis was discussed based on UNEP/SETAC guidelines. The subcategories
   and social indicators suggested in the guidelines were analyzed, and the
   indicators considered suitable for the comparison of PSS alternatives,
   considering the use phase, were identified. Other indicators from the
   PSS literature were also added to those from the guidelines. To analyze
   the consequences of PSS implementation, the applicability of
   consequential SLCA was discussed.
   The main results pointed out that only a few indicators in the SLCA
   guidelines could be used for comparative PSS analysis. This occurred
   because only some of the guidelines could be linked to the processes of
   each PSS. Other indicators identified in the PSS literature are
   suggested to complement the comparative analysis of PSS alternatives.
   Concerning the effects of PSS introduction, it can cause social impacts
   with regard to the company and stakeholders directly involved in the
   changes in addition to the effects that may occur in other products and
   services systems as a result of consumers' behavior and PSS interaction
   in the market. The consequential modeling is suggested as appropriate
   for this analysis.
   The SLCA approach can be considered suitable for PSS social issues
   analysis, although there are limitations for a full analysis in this
   study. Some major challenges for its applicability were identified.
   First, PSS functional unit modeling should be investigated considering
   all PSS elements (products and services) and the functions provided by
   the system. Second, only few indicators in the guidelines were
   considered appropriate for PSS comparative analysis before its
   introduction. Finally, concerning consequential SLCA, this could be
   explored in the context of PSS, but there is still scarce research on
   this subject. In short, to establish SLCA as a useful and applicable

Abstract = {{National policies for science parks and innovation have been identified
   as one of the major driving forces for the innovation-driven economy,
   especially for publicly funded science parks. To investigate this
   collaborative ecosystem (government-academia-industry) for growth and
   sustainable development, this paper proposes a nation-wide economic
   impact analysis of science parks and innovation policy based on
   historical data drawn from one of the globally recognized
   high-technology industrial clusters in Taiwan. Systems thinking with
   causal loop analysis are adopted to improve our understanding of the
   collaborative ecosystem with science park policies. First, from a
   holistic viewpoint, the role of government in a science parks and
   innovation ecosystem is reviewed. A systems analysis of an
   innovation-driven economy with a science park policy is presented as a
   strategy map for policy implementers. Second, the added economic value
   and employment of the benchmarked science parks is evaluated from a long
   range perspective. Third, the concepts of government-academia-industry
   collaboration and policies to innovation ecosystem are introduced while
   addressing the measures and performance of innovation and applied R\&D
   in the science parks. We conclude with a discussion of lessons learned
   and the policy implications of science park development and an
   innovation ecosystem.}},

Title = {{Balancing formal and informal success factors perceived by supply chain
   stakeholders: A study of woody biomass energy systems in Japan}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{175}},
Pages = {{50-59}},
Month = {{FEB 20}},
Abstract = {{Small-scale woody biomass energy systems have an inherent ability to aid
   in emissions reduction while stimulating local economies and, as
   collective energy systems, are strongly connected to supply chain design
   based on local conditions and stakeholder integration. Despite an
   abundance of forest area alongside the promotion of biomass in energy
   policies, however, woody biomass utilization still remains low in Japan.
   The woody biomass supply chain, considered as a socio-technical system,
   involves a complex, cross-sectoral stakeholder network in which
   inter-organizational dynamics necessitates well-organized management
   based on an understanding of formal factors such as technology, as well
   as informal factors such as social relations and culture. In this paper,
   success factor perceptions from across the woody biomass supply chain
   are investigated based on semi-structured interviews with four
   stakeholders in the Kyushu region of Japan. Identified success factors
   here are: 1) respect of values \& traditions, 2) transportation
   infrastructure, 3) business model integration, 4) relationship \& trust,
   5) local vitalization and 6) biomass quality control. A convergence as
   well as divergence of perceptions are observed, involving both formal
   and informal dimensions. Aiming to balance perceptions and to enable
   long-term success of woody biomass in Japan, a series of policy
   implications are drawn, including cross-ministerial integration,
   knowledge building on wood logistics, forest certification, local
   coordinators, biomass quality control standards and a feed-in-tariff for
   heat. This paper suggests a new arena of policy-making based on the
   importance of considering both informal and formal dimensions in energy
   policy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Organizations, such as social enterprises, engage in business model
   innovation when they wish to create, deliver, and capture value for
   their various stakeholders in ways that effect positive environmental
   and social change. Despite the increasing research attention paid to
   social enterprises, the literature on business model innovation in this
   context is still scarce. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to
   explore business model innovation driven by sustainability issues at a
   social enterprise operating in the Scan-dinavian electricity retail
   market. A single case study research approach is taken, and data are
   collected from sixteen individual interviews and two ? focus groups with
   executives, managers, and directors. The study contributes to business
   model innovation as an organizational change process as well as an
   outcome of this process. The findings show that business model
   innovation over time at social enterprises reflects a shift in focus
   from novelty, via lock-in of customers, to efficiency in internal
   management routines. Additionally, the study concludes that social
   enterprises with innovative business models driven by sustainability
   issues can introduce novel practices that lead to changes in the
   dominant business model of their industry. The study also suggests how
   social entrepreneurs might innovate their business models as they focus
   on environmental and social sustainability. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The subjectivity, complexity, and often competing interests of
   sustainable development have limited the effectiveness of integrating
   these important ideas into mainstream business strategy. With the
   adoption of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in January 2016,
   there are now global sustainability benchmarks that apply across diverse
   sectors and national contexts, allowing public and private organizations
   to orient and evaluate their activities, strategies, and business
   outcomes. However, it is not directly apparent where the advantage for
   business lies in pursuit of these actions within the prevailing economic
   paradigm, highlighting the need for new analytical frameworks and tools.
   Industrial ecology (IE) has been successfully used in engineering
   practice for decades and has been suggested as a method that can provide
   the concepts and methods necessary to bridge the gap between traditional
   business practice and sustainable development. To test this, literature
   bridging the fields of industrial ecology, business strategy, and
   sustainable development was collected and analyzed using the textual
   analysis software Leximancer (TM). The analysis showed that while the
   SDGs are primarily aimed at the national level, they also hold relevance
   for business through innovation, partnerships, and strategic
   positioning, inter alia. The analysis found that the integration of IE
   and business strategy is highly relevant for three of the SDGs, but
   captures elements of all 17 to varying degrees. IE has a strong focus on
   innovation and its potential in new markets, products, and business
   models. IE is also consciously aimed at the efficient use of energy and
   resources, ideas that are relevant to mitigating, adapting, and building
   resilience in a changing future, but are also relevant to traditional
   concepts of business strategy and competitive advantage. This paper
   shows that through the combination of IE and strategic management
   theory, commercial organizations can positively contribute to the
   Sustainable Development Goals while building competitive advantage. (C)

Abstract = {{Despite a voluminous literature, business model research continues to be
   plagued with problems. Those problems hinder theory development and make
   it difficult for managers to use research findings in their
   decision-making. In our article, we seek to make three contributions.
   First, we clarify the theoretical foundations of the business model
   concept and relate them to the five elements of a business model:
   customers, value propositions, product/service offerings, value creation
   mechanisms, and value appropriation mechanisms. A clear definition of a
   business model enables theory to develop systematically and provides
   coherent guidance to managers. Second, we suggest that value
   configuration is a contingency variable that should be included in
   future theorizing and model building. Each of the elements of a business
   model is affected by a firm's value configuration depending on whether
   the firm is a value chain, value shop, or value network. Third, we link
   business models to organization design. We show how organization design
   is affected by value configuration and how new collaborative
   organizational forms enable open and agile business models. We derive
   the implications of our analysis for future research and management
   practice. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Corporate Venturing sets the stage for entrepreneurial behavior in order
   to create business model innovation (BMI). Moreover, prior literature
   indicates the importance of BMI as a source of performance advantage,
   especially in growing industries. However, an empirical examination of
   the effectiveness of entrepreneurial behaviors for achieving BMI is
   still lacking. Hence, this study investigates the effectiveness of
   effectuation and causation as primary entrepreneurial logics to create
   BMI. Analyzing data obtained from 128 corporate ventures with partial
   least squares structural equation modeling, the effectiveness of both
   entrepreneurial logics for BMI with respect to different industry growth
   levels is clarified: The results point out that both behaviors lead to
   BMI in situations of moderate industry growth while effectuation
   (causation) is more effective in high (low) industry growth settings.
   Furthermore, the results point out that BMI in turn enhances corporate
   venture performance. Thus, corporate entrepreneurs should carefully
   align their entrepreneurial approach with industry growth projections to
   effectively develop BMI and achieve high venture performance. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Solar energy is considered a clean and renewable and safe energy source.
   With the development of photovoltaic (PV) technology and reduction in
   costs of PV cells and modules, solar PV pumping irrigation has been
   widely applied throughout the world. Applying together with micro
   irrigation technology, PV pumping irrigation has demonstrated a robust
   fusion in rural development, ecological conservation, and a viable
   technology for increasing farmers' incomes and living standards by
   reducing poverty, and improving the living conditions of women by
   reducing labour intensity. This paper presents innovations in solar PV
   pumping technology, and a new business model and policy for enhancing
   the extension of solar PV pumping irrigation technology. Copyright (c)

Abstract = {{Specialty coffee markets that recognize coffee-quality price premiums
   can improve business conditions for smallholders and promote
   agro-ecological practices. We studied the Relationship Coffee Model
   (RCM), a business model that supports long-term partnerships between
   coffee buyers and smallholders based on product quality. We examined how
   biophysical conditions and production practices affect smallholders'
   ability to participate in this model. Furthermore, we considered common
   unobservable variables driving growers' participation such as farm soil
   quality and connection to social networks. In turn, we evaluated key
   environmental, socio-economic and technological outcomes, including tree
   and bird population diversity. Our estimations indicated that RCM
   participants employed more sustainable resource management practices,
   had better access to credit and were more informed and optimistic about
   the coffee business. However, we did not find significant farm-gate
   price differences. Increased adoption of organic farming and shade-grown
   systems to elevate coffee quality can stimulate sustainable business
   strategies. Copyright (c) 2018 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd and ERP

Abstract = {{Over the last decade, Product-Service System (PSS) has been established
   as a prominent business model which promises sustainability. A great
   amount of literature work has been devoted to PSS issues, but there is
   fairly limited published work on integrated and easily applicable
   evaluation methodologies for PSS design, as well as a lack of Lean PSS
   approaches. Contributing to these directions, the present work
   introduces a framework for the evaluation and improvement of the Lean
   PSS design using key performance indicators (KPIs), Lean rules, and
   sentiment analysis, aiming to feed all the stages of PSS design
   lifecycle. According to the evaluation phase, a certain appropriate set
   of KPIs is selected and suggested to the PSS designer via a
   context-sensitivity analysis (CSA) tool through a pool, which have been
   identified after intensive literature survey, and systematically
   classified into five main categories: design, manufacturing, customer,
   environment, and sustainability. According to the same phase, sentiment
   analysis has been used to identify the polarity of the customer opinions
   regarding the PSS offerings. During the phase of Lean design assistance,
   Lean rules are selected using CSA and are suggested to the designer to
   ensure the minimization of wasteful activities. Enabler for the context
   awareness is the availability of feedback gathered from the
   manufacturing, shop-floor experts, and the different types of customers
   (business or final-product consumers), as well as the PSS lifecycle
   which the designer treats. The proposed framework is implemented in a
   software prototype and is applied in a mold-making industrial case
   study.}},

Abstract = {{Entrepreneurs and investors face challenges in the `thin market' for
   early stage entrepreneurial finance. Improving this situation has been a
   priority of policy makers for at least a decade, however, the challenges
   in this matching process are still poorly understood. Theory suggests
   that matching problems may originate in different perceptions in areas
   such as evaluation criteria, risk and risk management by investors and
   entrepreneurs. To find a good match it seems essential to understand
   what is important to your counterpart. Based on a mixed methods approach
   using data collected in semi-structured interviews and a survey with
   both entrepreneurs and investors mostly active in green tech innovation,
   this study systematically analyses where their perceptions deviate and
   where frictions in the matching process may occur. We find that a
   mismatch exists in the perception of risk, the importance attached to
   risk, the search channels used to find a potential partner and the
   evaluation criteria applied in evaluating a proposition (i.e., exit,
   innovativeness, capabilities of teams). This paper suggests that
   increasing market transparency and creating a mutual understanding of
   the investment process will prevent potentially damaging perception
   misalignment from arising in the first place.}},

Abstract = {{While the literature on social scaling adopts a linear perspective in
   which a social enterprise first tests and validates its business model
   and then scales it up to other settings, this study argues that in
   uncertain and volatile environments, a more iterative approach may be
   appropriate. We develop an in-depth case study of ViaVia Travellers
   Cafes, a social enterprise that has successfully scaled its operations
   to 16 locations covering four continents. Through document analyses and
   twelve interviews with internal and external stakeholders, we are able
   to map and analyze the development process of the ViaVia Travellers
   Cafes, with information covering a period of more than 25 years. We find
   that under uncertainty, the social business model does not need to be
   proven before scaling it up. In fact, ViaVia Travellers had not yet
   developed a replicable model when scaling activities were undertaken. It
   regarded each new expansion as an experiment, and developed the business
   model's economic and social elements by learning from the portfolio of
   its previous experiments. Overcoming uncertainty hence involved
   simultaneously developing and scaling the business model. Our study
   introduces insights from the literature on business model development
   under uncertainty to the research on sustainable business models and
   social scaling, while contributing relevant insights for social
   entrepreneurs trying to scale. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{As companies and other organizations increasingly recognize society's
   demand for greater social and environmental sustainability, university
   and college business schools have responded with new pedagogic
   approaches. Business schools have begun to offer courses in business
   models and business model innovation that focus not only on
   profit-normative goals but also on social and environmental goals. This
   paper describes an Experiential Workshop for university undergraduates
   in which the Service-Learning pedagogic approach is taken and
   Flourishing Business Canvas is applied as a tool for collaborative
   visual business modelling. In the Workshop, the students work with
   business model innovation for a biogas production cooperative of
   farmer-members in southern Sweden. The students take the role of problem
   owners and problem-solvers as they co-create new business models ideas
   for the cooperative. The paper presents the students' achievement of
   three Learning Objectives as they engage in meaningful, ``real world{''}
   simulations with a high degree of autonomy that allows them to combine
   their theoretical knowledge with practice. Implications for educators
   who wish to test the Experiential Workshop in their classrooms are
   proposed. The paper concludes with the suggestion that Education for
   Flourishing is a useful expansion of Education for Sustainable
   Development. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years in Sweden, interest has grown concerning the
   possibilities of biogas production from organic waste. This interest
   reflects a general concern over environmental sustainability in society.
   However, given the lack of financial backing and the competition of
   other energy producers, few Swedish biogas plants have been profitable.
   This is particularly the situation with farm-based biogas producers. One
   response to this problem in the farm-based biogas industry is to engage
   in business model innovation that can lead to new ways of organizing
   business structures and activities. This qualitative study, which takes
   an action research approach, explores the early phases (initiation and
   ideation) of the business model innovation process for sustainability at
   a biogas-producing farm cooperative in southern Sweden. The main
   activities and the actors who are central to the execution of these
   activities are identified in six sub-phases. The paper describes two
   Flourishing Business Canvas workshops in which the participants were the
   researchers, members of the farm cooperative, external consultants, and
   university students. This study contributes theoretically to the
   literature with its detailed examination of the early phases of the
   business model innovation process for sustainability. It also
   contributes to practice with its conceptual model that demonstrates how
   biogas producers and farm managers can innovate and transform their
   current business models towards sustainability in order to improve
   competitiveness and long-term profitability. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Energy Performance Contracting (EPC) is a significant business mechanism
   to reduce energy consumption of existing buildings. At present, there
   are three basic business models of EPC: Guaranteed Savings Model,
   Shared-Savings Model and Energy Costs Hosting Model. We suppose that the
   Energy Costs Hosting Model, in which building owners, Energy Service
   Companies (ESCOs) and financial institutions can achieve optimal
   benefits, is the most suitable business model in the developing stage of
   EPC. We construct benefits distribution models which involve three
   stakeholders based on interval valued fuzzy Shapley value, adjust these
   values according to the actual allocation of energy-saving benefits and
   compare the benefits of the three stakeholders in the three business
   models. We conclude that Energy Costs Hosting Model can bring the
   maximum benefits to these three stakeholders and the participation of
   governments and authoritative institutions of authentication and
   appraisal can solve two major problems: `unshared information' and `lack
   of supervision system'. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The use of agricultural wastes as component of biodegradable materials
   represents a benefit for the environment, as well as for local economy.
   Our investigation has focused on the possibility to expand the use of
   some agriculture by-products by turning them into new biodegradable
   composites and to investigate their behaviour to accelerated weathering.
   We found that polylactic acid was more affected by the combined action
   of temperature, humidity and UV radiation as compared to composite
   materials. The tensile strength decreased by 73.66\% for polylactic acid
   as matrix, 26\% for the composite comprising celery root fibres, 3\% for
   the composite comprising Asclepias syriaca fibres and 1\% for the
   composite with poplar seed hair fibres. An increase of 31\% was
   registered for the material comprising pomace, which can be explained by
   biomass composition, where lignin is the major component. The increase
   of storage modulus with ageing could be related with the increase of
   rigidity and chain packing, which can be connected to an enhanced
   density induced by ageing. All composites showed increased water
   sorption capacity values, while Atomic Force Microscopy images revealed
   the deterioration of the surface of the materials exposed to the
   combined action of UV, temperature and humidity. Scanning Electron
   Microscopy images of weathered materials evidenced some voids between
   the filler particles and the poly lactic acid matrix, but most of the
   filler particles were still kept intact within the matrix. The economic
   study evidenced a great potential for achieving green materials at
   reasonable costs. The obtained results indicate that different biomass
   wastes can be used as filler for a polylactic acid matrix. In the
   pursuit of sustainable waste management, our findings can play a
   significant role in elaborating a business model. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{While there is growing awareness of the existence and activities of
   Academic Custom Writing websites, which form a small part of the
   contract cheating industry, how they work remains poorly understood.
   Very little research has been done on these sites, probably because it
   has been assumed that it is impossible to see behind their firewalls and
   password protection. We have found that, with some close scrutiny, it is
   indeed possible to find some `cracks' in these sites through which we
   can look to gain insights into the business processes that operate
   within them. We have reverse engineered the business processes that
   operate within some of these sites. From this we have also been able to
   identify three different business models that are supported by these
   sites. Our analysis supports important findings about how these sites
   operate that can be used to inform future strategies to detect and deter
   contract cheating.}},

Title = {{Social innovation and SONO filter for drinking water}},
Journal = {{SOCIETY AND BUSINESS REVIEW}},
Year = {{2018}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - Bangladesh is facing an alarming situation with the drinking
   water in its most areas, as groundwater used for drinking has been
   contaminated with naturally occurring inorganic arsenic. Many
   entrepreneurs along with the government are trying to cope up with this
   problem. SONO filter is one of them that is based on the social
   innovation concept. Social innovation is defined as innovative
   products/services motivated by the goal of meeting a social need, with
   the opportunity to create new social collaborations. This paper aims to
   examine the concepts of social innovation, which advocates enhancing
   values to society and the social benefit to all the stakeholders.
   Design/methodology/approach - This is an exploratory study and presents
   the evolution, the development of the social business model and its
   implementation. Abul Hussam initiated the social business concept
   through SONO filter that is commercialized through the Manob Sakti
   Unnayan Kendro. The study has been conducted entirely on the basis of
   documentary information and data available in the public domain.
   Findings - The findings show a hopeful contribution toward enhancing

   filter helps to mitigate the water-borne diseases and make people clean
   and safe, as well as healthy, by providing pure drinking water. Even by
   drinking pure water, people with arsenic-related diseases are getting
   better day by day through this social initiative.
   Originality/value - Business based on social innovation is a new and
   really a good working concept. It has faced many hurdles in its journey
   to meet social objectives. Many researchers, entrepreneurs, non-profit
   organizations, national planners and society leaders will surely be
   benefited by its solution.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the
   environment-strategy-structure fit in the context of industrial
   servitization and its impact on the profitability of manufacturing SMEs.
   Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from face-to-face
   interviews with the CEOs of 184 French manufacturing SMEs. These primary
   data were complemented by the indicators extracted from a financial
   database to ensure objective measures of financial performance. Analyses
   were conducted by means of partial least squares structural equation
   modeling.
   Findings The research tests the impact of the organizational design
   (customer interface, service delivery system and service culture (SC))
   on financial performance. It also tests the moderating effect on this
   relationship of servitization strategies adopted by the firm (added
   services (AS), activities reconfiguration (AR) and business model
   reconfiguration (BMR)) and the environment in which the firm is situated
   (industry dynamism, competitive intensity and industry munificence).
   Research limitations/implications This study considers the coalescence
   of the environment-strategy-structure to be a driver of firm performance
   in the context of industrial firms' servitization. Three specific
   servitization strategies (AS, AR and BMR) are suggested based on the
   service offering's impact on the customer's activity chain or business
   model.
   Practical implications The research proposes some optimal organizational
   design depending on servitization strategy and environmental factors;
   for example, SC has a strong impact on financial performance when BMR is
   adopted.
   Originality/value This empirical study is based on an extended sample of
   184 SMEs and provides quantitative support for the claim that good
   alignment between strategy and organizational design based on
   environmental factors increases profitability.}},

Abstract = {{Sweden's agriculture industry has faced many challenges in recent years.
   Among the most severe challenges are the decrease in the number of small
   and medium-sized farms, the decrease in the number of people employed in
   agricultural activities, and the increase in governmental regulations
   and legislation governing such activities. At the same time, the demand
   that agriculture contributes to sustainable social and ecological
   development has increased. Although research shows that sustainable
   business model innovation (SBMI) contributes to the creation of
   sustainable businesses and to the development of a sustainable society,
   Swedish agriculture has not been at the forefront in the use of SBMI.
   The purpose of this paper is to examine the barriers to SBMI in Swedish
   agriculture in order to understand why farmers seldom engage in SBMI.
   This qualitative study follows the Gioia methodology and data for the
   analysis were acquired in semi-structured interviews with entrepreneurs
   at six family farms in Sweden. The paper makes a theoretical
   contribution to the research on SBMI with its focus on sustainable
   entrepreneurship in the Swedish agricultural industry. The paper
   concludes that the barriers to SBMI are external, internal, and
   contextual.}},

Abstract = {{A shared understanding of the basic requirements for modelling
   sustainability-oriented business is currently missing. This is hindering
   collaboration, exchange and learning about sustainability-oriented
   business models as well as the development of suitable and
   widely-accepted modelling tools. We contribute toward such a shared
   understanding based on a theoretical discussion of boundary-spanning and
   interactive business model development for sustainable value creation.
   The theoretical discussion feeds into a comparative analysis of the six
   currently available practitioner tools supporting the exploration and
   elaboration of sustainability-oriented business models. By synthesising
   findings from theory and available tools, we define four guiding
   principles (sustainability-orientation, extended value creation,
   systemic thinking and stakeholder integration) and four process-related
   criteria (reframing business model components, context-sensitive
   modelling, collaborative modelling, managing impacts and outcomes) for
   the development of sustainability-oriented business models.}},

Abstract = {{The proliferation of free on-demand music streaming services (e.g.,
   Spotify) is offsetting the traditional revenue sources (e. g., purchases
   of downloads or CDs) of the music industry. In order to increase revenue
   and sustain business, the music industry is directing its efforts toward
   increasing paid subscriptions by converting free listeners into paying
   subscribers. However, most companies are struggling with these attempts
   because they lack a clear understanding of the psychological and social
   purchase motivations of consumers. This study compares and contrasts the
   two different phases of Millennial generation consumer behaviors: the
   alluring phase and the hooking phase. A survey was conducted with 73
   paying users and 163 non-paying users of on-demand music streaming
   services. The authors' data analysis shows two separate behavioral
   dynamics seen between these groups of users. While social influence and
   attitude are primary drivers for the non-paying users in the alluring
   phase, facilitating conditions and communication control capacity play
   critical roles for the paying users in the hooking phase. These results
   imply that the music industry should apply different approaches to
   prospective and current customers of music streaming services.}},

Abstract = {{Product-service system (PSS) is a business model designed to help
   enterprises achieve servitisation. PSS not only considers
   service-oriented logic to increase product value but also supports
   enterprises with waste reduction. An increasing number of studies have
   emphasised PSS development. However, much of the literature remains
   focused on separate development phases, such as idea generation or a
   specific product or industry application. An integrative system
   modelling methodology designed to help companies formulate a complete
   scenario is absent. This study provides a methodology for developing a
   systematic and complete PSS strategy. It combines failure modes and
   effects and importance-performance analysis to identify potential
   customer needs. A service-product development matrix and a
   product-service life cycle analysis are developed. Following the service
   concepts generation, grey relational analysis and scenario analysis are
   utilised to evaluate the alternatives. A case study involving the
   clothing industry was conducted to test the proposed approach. Results
   indicate the methodology can help service providers identify existing
   problems and develop service alternatives systematically. These
   alternatives can then be evaluated and the scenario which achieves the
   highest profitability, is the most environmental friendly, and is the
   most social friendly can be identified.}},

Abstract = {{This article describes how digital disruption transforms all industries,
   leading to new business models based on the new technologies. In
   manufacturing, one model for digital disruption is Industrie 4.0,
   supported mainly in Germany. Proposals for Industrie 4.0 involve the
   virtualization and vertical and horizontal integration of the value
   chain, digital services, the digital transformation of products, the
   digital transformation of production equipment, the digital
   transformation of factories and supply chains. Whereas the former two
   are already in place today, the latter is researched and developed.
   Products and production equipment will be transformed from physical to
   cyber-physical. Together, they will negotiate as peers over the Internet
   of Things and form smart factories. Via the Internet of Services, the
   entire supply chain will be integrated. The most popular business model
   is mass customization, according to which the customer order triggers
   production and logistics in the entire supply chain. Siemens intends to
   use information technology to migrate customers to tomorrow's
   digitalization.}},

Title = {{Angel investors' predictive and control funding criteria: The importance
   of evolving business models}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN MARKETING AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{34-56}},
Abstract = {{Purpose This study aims to investigate the question involving what
   factors affect angel investors' decision-making in funding new start-ups
   with specific reference to their evolving business models. Without
   funding and access to networks and experience, certain entrepreneurs
   will not get their business model through the start-up phase.
   Design/methodology/approach Data arise from 20 semi-structured
   interviews with angel investors in New Zealand plus supplementary
   interviews with business incubator managers and textual data.
   Findings The findings suggest a degree of causation-based
   decision-making, in that certain linear thinking was evident. The
   implication is that, without the ability of the entrepreneurs to
   convince the investors about key criteria in their decision-making,
   investment is unlikely. Nevertheless, a degree of effectuation-based
   decision-making was also evident, the implication being investors having
   to balance risk/reward decisions in the context of their own perceptions
   of affordable losses against an evolving business model. However, angel
   investors may take on co-investment, including from overseas, that takes
   decision-making away from management teams.
   Originality/value The study draws attention to the need to consider
   entrepreneurial ecosystems in angel investor's decision-making and
   especially those with a small domestic market that may require
   management teams to look for scalability internationally. Furthermore,
   an effectuation lens contributes to knowledge in respect of predictive
   and control criteria, in particular, assessing risks and rewards against
   affordable losses involving an evolving business model.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of this research paper is to discuss the evolution
   in business models (BM) of one key player (Netflix) in the French online
   streaming video services market.
   Design/methodology/approach The paper is based on a qualitative approach
   (Netflix case study based on secondary data) to reduce the gap between
   theory and business practice.
   Findings Through technological convergence, the movie and video industry
   has seen dramatic changes in the means of consumption, forcing the
   traditional media players to evolve and adapt their strategy and BM to
   face new entrants (mainly IT companies). Coopetitive practices have been
   developed in spite of a fierce competition in the French market with
   impact on BM. Netflix is representative of this evolution.
   Research limitations/implications This qualitative research is based on
   a case study. The results of a single case study cannot be used to make
   generalizations. Certainly, this paper represents only a first step.
   Further research is required in this field.
   Originality/value The originality of this paper is to expand the
   understanding of BMs by including various strategic and marketing
   perspectives and analyze the impact of coopetitive practices on the BM
   of one key player: Netflix.}},

Abstract = {{Circular modes of production, known as the circular economy, are
   welcomed in political and business circles to overcome the shortcomings
   of traditional linear operating models. This article presents
   preliminary propositions concerning implications for the development of
   what we term circular supply chains', defined here as the embodiment of
   circular economy principles within supply chain management. Our
   propositions are based on the following arguments: a shift from product
   ownership to leasing and access in supply chain relationships; the
   relevance of structural flexibility and start-ups in regional or local
   loops; open and closed material loops in technical and biological
   cycles; closer collaboration within and beyond immediate industry
   boundaries and public and private procurement in the service industry as
   a lever for the scaling up of circular business models. We discuss what
   these circular economy principles mean in terms of supply chain
   challenges and conclude with limitations and future research agenda.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of this study is to help gain an accurate and
   distinct understanding of information-based business concepts and
   critical steps in designing an appropriate business model, by providing
   a framework for designing an innovative information-based business to
   help fledgling businesses development in the information and
   communication technology (ICT) industry of Iran. What is a business
   model framework with the strategic innovation approach in the small and
   medium enterprises (SMEs) of ICT industry? What are the components of
   this model and the relations between them? Business model is a logical
   response to how a business can create value. Changing business
   environment means that business models are rapidly growing; accordingly,
   innovation is no longer optional. However, innovation is important in
   general, but the kind of innovation that is widely and directly
   dependent on business model will be quite critical for all parts of the
   organization. In fact, business model innovation is an exquisite technic
   to create, deliver and earn value by changing one or more components of
   a typical business model. Business model innovation needs information
   and form business environment based on dynamic information system.
   Design/methodology/approach The present paper focuses upon SMEs in ICT.
   Grounded theory has been used for this purpose, with 15 interviews
   conducted.
   Findings An emerging market is one in which commercial exchanges of a
   particular industry between the countries are relatively new but possess
   great investment attractiveness and a high potential to grow (such as
   Iran).As the ICT industry of Iran is a leading industry, and the country
   itself is an emerging market, the main purpose of this study is to
   provide a framework for designing an innovative information-based
   business to help fledgling businesses development in the ICT industry of
   Iran.
   Originality/value The purpose of this paper is to help accurate and
   distinct understanding of the business model concept and critical steps
   in designing an appropriate business model. Studies conducted to
   simultaneously deal with the business model and strategic innovations
   are few, and by the time the proposal was written, there was no research
   observed from Persian sources.}},

Title = {{Conducting Business Experiments Validating New Business Models
   Well-designed business experiments can help validate assumptions and
   reduce risk associated with new business models}},
Journal = {{RESEARCH-TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{27-35}},
Abstract = {{Breakthrough innovation inside established companies-innovation that
   creates new revenue streams-often requires business model innovation in
   addition to innovation in product or offering. Unfortunately, new
   business models are rife with uncertainty. They may require new channels
   or new partnerships, appeal to new customer sets, rely on different
   revenue models, or require unfamiliar technologies. The risk associated
   with creating new business models is a major reason high-potential new
   businesses are not launched inside established companies. Well-designed
   business experiments are a valuable tool for reducing that risk.
   Although business experiments are not new, much of the literature
   concerning such experiments focuses on software and Internet businesses,
   where experiments are easier to conduct, and on startup companies rather
   than large corporations. This paper addresses the conduct of experiments
   in companies that produce physical goods and addresses the issues
   associated with conducting experiments within an established company. It
   describes methods used to design experiments, to focus them on critical
   issues, and to manage them in a corporate context.}},

Title = {{Business model design and firm performance Evidence of interactive
   effects from a developing economy}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INNOVATION MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{315-333}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the literature
   on business model (BM) design by deepening the relationship between BM
   design themes and performance in a sample of firms based in a developing
   country. In particular, the authors deepen the relationship between
   business model novelty (BMN), business model efficiency (BME), the
   trade-off between novelty and efficiency - that the authors call BM
   ambidexterity - and performance.
   Design/methodology/approach - Data are drawn from a sample of 107
   manufacturing and service firms based in a developing country (Albania).
   Hierarchical regression is used to assess the impact on firm performance
   from the two BM design themes and their interaction.
   Findings - The authors find novelty-centred BM design is significantly
   related to firm performance while efficiency-centred design has no
   direct effect on performance. However, the authors also find that BME
   positively moderates the relationship between BMN and firm performance.
   Research limitations/implications - The relationship between BM design
   and firm performance can be better understood if contextualised. In the
   paper, the authors find that different types of BM designs have
   different impacts on the performance of firms based in a developing
   economy. While novelty matters, quite surprisingly the authors find no
   support for efficiency. Additionally, the authors find the interaction
   between the two design themes (BM ambidexterity) to have a positive
   impact on firm performance.
   Practical implications - The surveyed firms based in a developing
   economy appear to benefit from novelty-centred BM designs.
   Efficiency-centred designs have a more ambiguous role: while efficiency
   alone seems not to pay off, an efficient BM design may facilitate the
   market exploitation of a novel design.
   Originality/value - This study responds to a precise call for additional
   quantitative empirical studies on the relationship between BM and
   performance. The study also contributes to an emerging stream of
   research focused on BM ambidexterity.}},

Abstract = {{Construction companies need to formulate sustainable construction
   business strategies to create a competitive advantage and remain in the
   market. This requires that construction firms incorporate sustainability
   into their business model. However, the current situation of the firm
   must be known before following the path to be a sustainable construction
   firm. Therefore, the aim of this research is to identify sustainable
   business strategies and their level of implementation in Chilean
   construction companies. A survey was designed and applied to 245
   construction firms to provide statistically valid and reliable
   information, thus supporting both the senior managers' decision-making
   process and the companies' strategic planning. The main results show
   that the companies do not pursue business strategies that promote
   profound organizational changes; instead, they focus their short-term
   efforts on urgent market demands. This is evidenced by the lack of the
   function of sustainability management as a permanent role in the
   organization. Also, this study found that only 32\% of Chilean
   construction companies implement business strategies towards
   sustainability. Construction firms with higher turnover and subjected to
   stricter regulations, such as construction companies working in the
   mining sector, incorporate more sustainable business strategies across
   their organizations. The lack of a sustainability-oriented vision can
   affect the transformation of strategy into a competitive advantage, a
   step that is necessary to support both the company's permanence in the
   market and its long-term sustainability.}},

Abstract = {{This article concerns the nineteenth century tailoring firm of E.Moses
   and Son and explores their significance in laying the foundations for
   modern mass-market retailing in men's fashion. EMoses and Son were in
   operation between 1829 and 1884, and in the 55 years that they were in
   business, they achieved considerable success by bringing together new
   technologies and ideas of the time. Through their revolutionary attitude
   to commerce, E.Moses and Son pioneered a modern and more democratic
   fashion platform and, despite their virtual absence from fashion
   history, they hold an important place in the history of fashion and of
   commercial progress. Against a backdrop of social and economic change,
   brought about by industrialization and a re-structuring of the
   traditional English class system, Elias Moses and his son Isaac
   recognized a growing appetite for the consumption of new, affordable and
   accessible fashionable clothing. They pioneered a new business model
   that reduced the cost of fashions that operated on low margins and
   high-turn-over. This research explores how this was achieved by
   implementing new methods of production through innovative use of display
   and promotion, and perhaps most significantly, by devising an aggressive
   marketing strategy that appealed to a mass market by promoting the idea
   of classlessness. In their heyday, E.Moses and Son played many important
   roles: during the 1840s they became the preeminent men's tailoring
   business in London, pioneering new methods of production and promotion;
   during the 1850s they also became fashion connoisseurs, offering
   guidance on style and fashions of the day. By the 1860s, they began to
   theorize about the fashion, taking ideas that contemplated fashion
   philosophically and simplifying and re-branding them for mass
   consumption. E.Moses and Son may have existed for a relatively short
   moment in time, however, their methods have had a lasting impact on the
   development of modern mass-market tailoring.}},

   in a venture pitch competition during a cleantech accelerator program.
   Design/methodology/approach It uses competition results and data from a
   website used by participants to track their hypothesis construction and
   testing.
   Findings Teams that used the elements of customer segment, value
   proposition, key activities or key partnerships performed significantly
   better in the competition. Yet of all nine elements in the Canvas, only
   customer segmentation showed a significant linear bivariate correlation
   between the number of validated hypotheses and performance. Finally,
   teams that heavily used a triumvirate of elements composed of customer
   segmentation, value proposition and channel performed two times better
   than teams that barely used these elements.
   Research limitations/implications The findings of this exploratory
   analysis imply that the components of a business model that explain and
   predict early success might be different than those for a more mature
   firm.
   Practical implications These results suggest that practitioners could
   improve early performance by narrowing their scrutiny to just the
   triumvirate, because the Canvas may contain components that are
   unhelpful for entrepreneurs as they form a business model for their
   nascent venture.
   Originality/value This paper fills a gap by empirically testing the
   prediction that application of the Business Model Canvas drives venture
   success and providing a revise definition for a business model that is
   more appropriate for start-up ventures.}},

Abstract = {{This letter proposes a new business model for distribution network
   operators (DNOs)-shared network access (SNA), aiming to integrate
   flexible demand in a cost-effective manner. The SNA scheme incentivises
   the incumbent DNOs to give up its exclusive access to the network,
   leasing the spare capacity or back up capacity to a licensed independent
   party. The ownership of assets will be retained by the incumbent DNO
   while competition will be introduced in the operation of the spare
   capacity. The independent parties who have license for SNA will act as
   secondary DNOs, tapping into the spare capacity in the network to
   provide flexible network services for flexible generation and demand,
   thus substantially reduce the network access cost for flexibility. This
   paper quantifies the potential benefit of mobilizing spare capacity for
   flexibility network usage and discusses how the proposed business model
   can capture such value for each player. The results demonstrate that the
   competition brought by the proposed SNA can take advantage of the unused
   capacities in the existing network assets and be able to substantially
   increase their capability in integrating flexible demand and generation.}},

Title = {{Service Logic Business Model Canvas}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN MARKETING AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{70-98}},
Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of this study is to develop a service logic oriented
   framework for business model development. Service logic covers the basic
   principles of the three contemporary customer value focused business
   logics: service-dominant logic, service logic and customer-dominant
   logic.
   Design/methodology/approach This study is based on an empirical
   qualitative research and deployed the focus group method. The data are
   generated in a series of interactive co-creative focus group workshops
   involving both practitioners and academics.
   Findings As the outcome, a new tool was developed, called Service Logic
   Business Model Canvas. The new canvas is a modified version of the
   original Business Model Canvas (Osterwalder and Pigneur, 2010).
   Research limitations/implications This study adopts service logic in
   business model thinking and increases knowledge on how to keep the
   customer needs in the centre of business model development.
   Practical implications The developed canvas makes the theory of
   service-dominant logic tangible and easily applicable in practice. It
   enables service innovation truly based on customer value by ensuring
   that the customer is in the centre of all the elements of a business
   model. It can function both as a rapid prototype of a new business model
   and as a communication tool that quickly illustrates the company's
   current business model. It can also help in creating a customer-centred
   business culture. It is designed to be applied to each customer profile
   separately, thus enabling a deeper understanding of the customer logic
   of each relevant profile.
   Originality/value Earlier business model frameworks tend to be
   provider-centric and goods-dominant, and require further development and
   adaptation to service logic. This study adopts service logic in business
   model thinking. It embeds the true and deep customer understanding and
   customer value in each element of the business model, and contributes to
   both business model and service-dominant logic literature.}},

Abstract = {{Using a business model lens, we analyse local newspapers' paywall
   strategies and ask how monetisation has affected the newspapers'
   offerings to users and advertisers. Based on interviews with 20 local
   newspapers in Norway, findings suggest that paywalls represent two
   different strategies: A brake strategy in the user market, whereby the
   newspaper targets existing customers with bundled and differentiated
   products to secure subscription revenue and protect print from web
   cannibalisation. In addition, an acceleration strategy, in the
   advertiser market, focused on improving services with more relevant and
   valuable audiences and user behaviour insights from user data
   harvesting. Local newspapers have been relatively successful with
   balancing these two strategies, providing some optimism on paywalls'
   potential contribution to the funding of local journalism.}},

Title = {{Building excellence through the Agile Reengineering Performance Model
   (ARPM) A strategic business model for organizations}},
Journal = {{BUSINESS PROCESS MANAGEMENT JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{128-157}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to build a theoretic and
   practical framework, based on agile project management, to support the
   decision-making process in order to help companies in optimizing the
   reengineering production processes and improve management costs.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper seeks to propose an agile
   Reengineering Performance Model (ARPM) for managing projects of
   reengineering of processes and applies it in a real case study
   concerning a water bottling plant.
   Findings - The proposed model should serve as a valuable tool to
   facilitate a successful business process reengineering design in the
   project management and intends to assist companies as they operate
   projects of transferring and optimizing production lines. Thanks to the
   use of ARPM tools, it is easy to modify the evolution of the project,
   with the possibility of extending or enhancing the application if
   necessary.
   Research limitations/implications - The main limits of the ARPM model
   are: it requires close collaboration among team; it is rather intense
   for developers; and it is necessary flexibility to change course as
   needed and to ensure delivery of the right product.
   Practical implications - The main implications of the authors' work for
   research and business are to propose a structured methodological
   approach, rigorous but simple, suitable to implement in any companies.
   Originality/value - The novelty of the approach is to apply the agile
   approach not for software development but in a manufacturing company.}},

Abstract = {{The Belt and Road initiative is a novel exploration of China towards
   strategic collaboration with Eurasia countries to an extent of a larger
   scale with higher and deeper level of cooperation. To meet the growing
   global demand of transportation, increasing numbers of liner shipping
   companies collaborate and form alliances to share vessel capacity and
   reduce capital costs. Effective liner shipping vessel sharing is
   essential for the Belt and Road initiative in terms of building
   efficient maritime transport networks. In promoting environmental
   development, shipping companies are required to attain higher
   environmental standards. However, limited literature relates vessel
   sharing to environmental performance. This paper studies the impacts of
   liner vessel sharing from the economic and environmental perspectives.
   Two container allocation models are developed for the two scenarios:
   with and without vessel sharing. The carbon emissions in transportation
   are calculated under both scenarios. Numerical studies are carried out
   using services along the China-Indochina Peninsula Economic (CIPE)
   Corridor. Liner shipping companies could benefit from vessel sharing in
   terms of significant profit improvement. Vessel sharing could also
   benefit the environment by reducing the CO2 emissions dramatically.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose This paper aims to examine Borders response to business model
   innovation (BMI) by Amazon in the bookselling industry. The case
   illuminates potential causes for protracted periods of organizational
   unlearning, explaining why organizational unlearning, although
   beneficial in many documented cases, can also be insufficient to prevent
   failure.
   Design/methodology/approach Archival data are used to study Borders's
   historical evolution from 1995 to its 2011 bankruptcy. Theoretical
   inferences are drawn from this case to shed light on the process of
   organizational unlearning.
   Findings Borders failed because its top managers were unable to adjust
   its traditionalist superstore identity to respond in an adequate manner
   to the changes in their environment. Instead, the company went through
   protracted phases of weathering the storm, denial and unlearning,
   resulting in bankruptcy. This extreme case of failure explains why
   sometimes, organizational unlearning might be insufficient, resulting in
   organizational demise rather than renewal.
   Research limitations/implications A longitudinal study of an extreme
   case allows the author to build links between the research on
   organizational unlearning and the scholarship on organizational
   identity.
   Practical implications Organizations may survive longer if their top
   managers engage in the process of organizational identity change in
   response to BMI in their industry. The article proposes a few actions
   that organizations might usefully take to react to BMI before it is too
   late.
   Social implications Better understanding of failure may enable
   preventive behavior.
   Originality/value This article explains how organizational identity
   prevents learning the right things and augments the dangers
   organizations face during unlearning.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate how entrepreneurs
   market their business opportunities towards business angels in the
   investment process. This is achieved by introducing the business model
   canvas as a mitigating framework to help entrepreneurs in communicating
   and structuring the information desired by business angels.
   Design/methodology/approach This paper mobilises a case study approach
   by following a series of investment processes and investment meetings
   between entrepreneurs and business angels through 27 semi-structured
   interviews as well as participant observation and qualitative
   participant feedback from 13 investment processes.
   Findings The findings illustrate how introducing a framework like the
   business model canvas helps alleviate the informational and
   communication challenges between entrepreneurs and business angels.
   However, some problems occurred when the entrepreneurs and the business
   angels did not fully agree on the value proposition of the investment
   opportunity.
   Research limitations/implications The findings show that entrepreneurs
   who market their business cases to investors obtain better feedback and
   a higher chance of funding using the business model canvas. Implications
   of this paper also relate to the preparation of the entrepreneurs and
   that matchmakers between entrepreneurs and investors can use the
   business model canvas to facilitate such processes.
   Originality/value This paper contributes to both the theory of the
   investment process as well as the application of the business model
   canvas.}},

Abstract = {{Digital business model research spans the disciplines of information
   systems, marketing and entrepreneurship. Despite the growing research in
   the area there is a lack of understanding of how digital entrepreneurs
   identify business opportunities and conceptualize those in a business
   model. The literature on business models lacks consistent terminology
   and specification of critical components. Through an explorative study
   of digital entrepreneurs we examine how entrepreneurs identify business
   opportunities and how they translate them into a workable business idea.
   Although entrepreneurs typically have difficulty explaining their
   business model components we identified that critical features in our
   simplicity framework include three main modules, transaction/matching,
   marketing and back-office components, and simplicity in terms of value
   proposition, conceptualization approach and usability. This research
   proposes that a parsimonious view of digital business models, aligned
   with the lean start-up idea, makes sense for theory development and in
   terms of usefulness for entrepreneurs.}},

Title = {{When lock-ins impede value co-creation in service}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUALITY AND SERVICE SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{2-15}},
Abstract = {{Purpose This paper aims to demonstrate the relevance of identifying
   lock-ins that characterise a service, showing how lock-ins or
   impediments reinforce the status quo and prevent change. It provides an
   understanding of the factors hindering the development of value
   co-creation in this service.
   Design/methodology/approach The study is based on 19 semi-structured
   interviews with representatives of the Swedish waste management
   industry. It focusses on the difficulties that waste management
   companies encounter when they try to collaborate with their industrial
   customers to develop waste prevention services.
   Findings Four lock-ins that impede collaborative ways of working are
   identified: a business model based on short-term transactions rather
   than long-term relationships, a low level of self-confidence among waste
   managers regarding their competence to offer waste prevention services,
   non-supportive legal and economic institutional factors and existing
   waste processing infrastructures.
   Research limitations/implications Based on a case of waste services and
   to provide a better understanding of the rationale of value co-creation,
   this paper points to the generic relevance of investigating situations
   in which value co-creation encounters difficulties.
   Practical implications The authors identify the fact that lock-ins
   impeding value co-creation can act as a roadmap for the development of
   new services.
   Originality/value By focusing on a case of unsuccessful value
   co-creation, the paper offers a counterpoint to cases of successful
   value co-creation.}},

Abstract = {{Entrepreneurial ventures increasingly aim at developing viable business
   models for solving societal or ecological challenges. Such business
   models for sustainability (BMfS) build on reinforcing mechanisms of
   value creation and capture that allow achieving financial and
   sustainability objectives simultaneously. To date, we do not know much
   about the successful design of such business models. This research aims
   to reduce this gap by experimentally exploring their scalability and
   robustness in different environmental conditions. Rooted in the
   literature on business models and innovation adoption, we develop a
   simulation model that integrates various dimensions of BMfS. We apply
   the simulation to Coursera, an entrepreneurial venture with the social
   mission of making high-quality education globally accessible. The
   simulation allows us to test hypotheses about the venture's financial
   and sustainability performance over time. We find that the business

Abstract = {{Since 2005, journalism has experienced a series of seismic changes due
   to economic factors, technological changes, and shifting priorities and
   news values. Photojournalism has been particularly affected by
   technology and business model changes, leading more outlets to rely on
   often geographically remote freelancers at the expense of dedicated
   photo staffs. These remote working environments and the mediated
   communication they necessitate have profound impacts for
   photojournalists' development, roles, and responsibilities. Through
   in-depth interviews with photo editors and freelancers at top media
   outlets in the United States and guided by professional socialization,
   mentoring, and learning theories, this study explores what happens when
   the photojournalist-editor relationship is strained, mediated, or
   severed. It also seeks to examine what impact mediated interactions have
   on photographers' learning and the quality of the media they produce.
   The findings reveal that the post-digital freelance model is more linear
   than the hierarchical staffer model and has a positive influence on
   workforce diversity, albeit at the expense of freelancers' professional
   development and their opportunities to receive feedback from editors.}},

Abstract = {{Business model innovation (BMI) is the process of integrating a new
   logic of doing business into an established firm to improve
   profitability or to capitalise on new business opportunities. However,
   existing research offers only limited clarity on BMI compared to
   business model upgrades or a specific product innovation. From a body of
   extant literature, we develop a BMI identification tool which is then
   tested by senior managers from four large European corporations to
   assess whether innovation efforts represent BMI. The tool
   operationalises BMI and offers straightforward criteria and indicators
   to assist researchers but especially practitioners at accelerating BMI
   in established firms. This paper closes with recommendations for future
   research and limitations.}},

Abstract = {{Established theory suggests that firms experiment with business models
   in dynamic contexts. However, the relationship between business model
   experimentation and organisational performance remains unclear. For this
   purpose, we propose an assessment of the economic value of business
   model experimentation in dynamic contexts by defining the unit of
   analysis at the industry level. Analysis draws upon a unique panel
   dataset from the recorded music industry composed of 414 observations
   from 32 countries for the period 1998-2010. The results show two optimal
   modes for maximising value capture in dynamic contexts. First, if a
   dominant format exists, a `network' effect becomes prevalent which has a
   positive impact upon revenue. Second, when firms engage in
   experimentation leading to a highly diversified set of business models
   the industry sector becomes better able to capture value from diverse
   and changing consumer needs.}},

Title = {{Critical Factors Influencing Business Model Innovation for Sustainable
   Buildings}},
Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Despite significant policy drives, the wide adoption of sustainable
   building (SB) is hindered by factors such as high upfront cost and long
   payback period. Business model (BM) innovation is therefore highly
   demanded to help SB professionals to cope with the challenges and
   convert the value of SB into profit. Nevertheless, few studies examined
   BM innovation in the building sector and factors influencing BM
   innovation for SB are unclear. This paper aims to identify the critical
   factors that propel companies to innovate BM for SB. First, a literature
   review and expert interviews were conducted to identify and filter the
   drivers for BM innovation within the SB context. Second, a questionnaire
   survey was conducted to collect data on the significance of the selected
   influencing factors from 132 SB professionals. Finally, a model based on
   fuzzy set theory was used to ascertain the critical factors influencing
   BM innovation for SB. Twenty-four critical influencing factors in six
   categories from the external environment and internal organization were
   finalized, namely, market and economic, policy and legislation,
   technology and industry structure, social-culture, entrepreneurship, and
   organizational learning. The findings illuminate the motivations when
   developing BM for sustainability and provide strategies on BM innovation
   for practitioners and policy makers.}},

Abstract = {{We depart from existing literature by invoking analysts' forecasts to
   measure banking system opacity and then investigate the impact of such
   opacity on bank risk-taking, using a large panel of US bank holding
   companies, over the 1995-2013 period. We uncover three new results.
   Firstly, we find that opacity increases insolvency risks among banks.
   Secondly, we establish that the relationship between opacity and bank
   risk-taking is accentuated by the degree of banking market competition.
   Thirdly, we show that the bank business model moderates the risk-taking
   incentives of opaque banks, albeit only marginally. Overall, these
   findings suggest that the analysts forecast measure of bank opacity is
   useful for understanding risk-taking by publicly-traded banks, with
   important implications for bank stability. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Introduction: For telemonitoring to support care coordination, a sound
   business model is conditional. The aim of this study is to explore the
   systemic and economic differences in care coordination via
   business-to-business and business-to-consumer models for telemonitoring
   patients with chronic diseases.
   Methods: We performed a literature search in order to design the
   business-to-business and business-to-consumer telemonitoring models, and
   to assess the design elements and themes by applying the activity system
   theory, and describe the transaction costs in each model. The design
   elements are content, structure, and governance, while the design themes
   are novelty, lock-in, complementarities, and efficiency. In the
   transaction cost analysis, we looked into all the elements of a
   transaction in both models.
   Results: Care coordination in the business-to-business model is designed
   to be organized between the places of activity, rather than the
   participants in the activity. The design of the business-to-business
   model creates a firm lock-in but for a limited time. In the
   business-to-consumer model, the interdependencies are to be found
   between the persons in the care process and not between the places of
   care. The differences between the models were found in both the design
   elements and the design themes.
   Discussion: Care coordination in the business-to-business and
   business-to-consumer models for telemonitoring chronic diseases differs
   in principle in terms of design elements and design themes. Based on the
   theoretical models, the transaction costs could potentially be lower in
   the business-to-consumer model than in the business-to-business, which
   could be a promoting economic principle for the implementation of
   telemonitoring.}},

Abstract = {{The nuclear industry is experiencing significantly difficult times, and
   one of the crucial concerns is that the construction of new power plants
   is being stymied by the lack of long-term investment capital.
   State-owned investment funds, frequently referred to as sovereign wealth
   funds (SWFs), represent the fastest-growing group of global investors
   whose total assets under management have soared from \$2 billion in 2005
   to \$6.6 billion in 2014, according to the United Nations Conference on
   Trade and Development (UNCTAD) are simultaneously looking for investment
   opportunities with long term horizon and guaranteed stable income.
   An example of the symbiotic relationship is the one between Rosatom -
   the Russian Federation National Nuclear Corporation and the Russian
   SWFs. It demonstrates a specific business model where the SWF serves as
   a funding and financial guarantee authority for the state-owned
   corporation. This kind of relationship offers unique advantages to the
   entire industry, significantly strengthens Russia's international
   position, and contributes substantially to government revenues.
   Despite its economic and political advantages, this model also involves
   specific threats, especially in times of economic recession when a large
   fiscal deficit can have a devastating impact on the whole industry and
   simultaneously lead to severe damage in international relationships. (C)

Abstract = {{Existing academic literature is inconclusive about characteristics and
   viability of the long-haul low cost airline business model, whereas
   several airlines of this type are emerging. This article aims to
   validate its defining characteristics by clustering a sample of 37
   transatlantic airlines using principal component and hierarchical
   cluster analyses along a newly constructed long-haul airline business
   model framework. To contribute to the evaluation of business model
   viability, cost differences between clusters are uncovered subsequently
   followed by a discussion of their sustainability. Key findings include
   the characterization of the emerging long-haul LCC business model and
   its significant differences from existing legacy hub and leisure carrier
   models. On a cluster average, 33\% lower unit costs compared to legacy
   hub carriers were identified, of which 24 percentage points were
   evaluated as sustainable.}},

Abstract = {{Fraud with online payment services is an ongoing problem, with
   significant financial-economic and societal impact. One of the main
   modus operandi is financial malware that compromises consumer and
   corporate devices, thereby potentially undermining the security of
   critical financial systems. Recent research into the underground economy
   has shown that cybercriminals are organised around highly specialised
   tasks, such as pay-per-install markets for infected machines,
   malware-as-a-service and money mule recruitment. Setting up a successful
   financial malware scheme requires the aligning of many moving parts.
   Analysing how cybercrime groups acquire, combine and align these parts
   into value chains can greatly benefit from existing insights into the
   economics of online crime. Using transaction cost economics, this paper
   illustrates the business model behind financial malware and presents
   three novel value chains therein. For this purpose, we use a conceptual
   synthesis of the state-of-the-art of the literature on financial
   malware, underground markets and (cyber)crime economics, as well as
   today's banking practice.}},

Abstract = {{Electricity markets in liberalised nations are composed primarily of
   private firms that make strategic decisions about how to secure
   competitive advantage. Energy transitions, driven by decarbonisation
   targets and technological innovation, will create new markets and
   destroy old ones in a re-configuration of the power sector. This
   research suggests that by 2050 up to 21 bnGBP per year of new financial
   value is available in the UK electricity system, and that depending on
   scenario, these new values represent up to 31\% of the entire
   electricity sector. To service these markets business model innovation
   and new firm strategies are needed in electric power provision. Energy
   scenarios can inform strategic decisions over business model adaptation,
   but to date scenario modelling has not directly addressed firm strategy
   and behaviour. This is due in part to neo-classical assumptions of firm
   rationality and perfect foresight. This research adopts a resource based
   view of the firm rooted in evolutionary economics to argue that
   quantifying the relative size of the markets created and destroyed by
   energy transitions can provide useful insight into firm behaviour and
   innovation policy.}},

Abstract = {{As an alternative to the conventional R\&D innovation, business models
   are becoming an important locus of lucrative innovation. Due to the rise
   of the internet economy, business model innovation today often involves
   technological innovation, and this can be evidenced by business method
   (BM) patents. Of several mechanisms that stimulate business model
   innovation, the role of BM patents is probably most noteworthy. To
   understand how BM patents play their roles in business model innovation,
   we need to observe the long-term knowledge flow process. Therefore, we
   aim to identify dynamic patterns of knowledge flows driven by BM patents
   using a hidden Markov model (HMM) and patent citation data as an input.
   An HMM is a popular statistical tool for modelling a wide range of time
   series data. Since it does not have any general theoretical limit in
   regard to statistical pattern classification, an HMM is capable of
   characterizing various temporal patterns. A case study is conducted with
   the BM patents in 16 USPTO subclasses related to secure transactions.
   After patterns of the individual subclasses are generated, they are
   grouped into four major patterns through clustering analysis and their
   characteristics are closely examined. Our analysis reveals that the BM
   patents for secure transaction in general play increasingly important
   roles in advancement of business models, facilitating the transfer of
   knowledge, and thus can provide valuable insights in formulating more
   effective strategies or policies for business model innovation.}},

Abstract = {{Manufacturing companies that adopt the servitization strategy usually
   show lack of knowledge regarding the service offering associated to
   their manufactured products. Acquiring external knowledge from service
   suppliers can be a way to tackle this problem. The objective of this
   study is to understand how manufacturing companies aiming at a
   servitization-driven business model innovation (BMI) integrate such
   knowledge from service suppliers. We focus on different types of
   collaboration that can occur and on the knowledge sharing (KS) dynamics
   of this collaboration. We employ a multiple-case study approach to
   analyze nine BMI processes from companies that transformed their
   traditional business model (BM) to a servitized BM. As a result, we
   obtain a theoretical framework that presents six possible KS dynamics
   for the servitization design by originally combining two main approaches
   for servitization-driven BMI (i.e. product-oriented and service-oriented
   product-service systems) and three main configurations of relationships
   with service suppliers based on traditional new product development
   classifications of buyer-supplier integration (i.e. white, grey and
   black box configurations). Implications of combining a BMI and a
   buyer-supplier KS perspectives to investigate the process of
   servitization for manufacturing companies are then discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Health information exchanges (HIEs) are new organizational forms in the
   United States that facilitate digital exchange of health data across
   participants. Many believe that these multi-sided digital platforms will
   become key enablers of the digital transformation of healthcare in the
   United States. However, like other entrepreneurial ventures, HIEs face
   challenges to achieve operational maturity and financial viability.
   Entrepreneurial ventures often fail to attain financial viability due to
   the initial design of the business model and the inability to evolve the
   model over time. We focus on the influence of service offerings, revenue
   models, and their evolution on the viability of HIEs. Using a unique
   archival data-set constructed from surveys of HIEs in the United States
   from 2008 to 2010, we find that providing an extensive service bundle
   may lead to higher operational maturity with the HIE's increasing age,
   but this may deter the HIE's potential to achieve financial viability.
   The findings also show that the influence of service offerings on
   financial viability is mediated by operational maturity. Qualitative
   evidence corroborates these findings and suggests that HIEs need to move
   from providing a set of foundational services to offering more advanced
   services as they evolve and that they need to appropriately bundle the
   services using transaction-, subscription- or mixed-fee models. We
   discuss how these findings contribute to research at the intersection of
   operations management and information systems and offer important
   implications for HIEs with regard to crafting and evolving appropriate
   service offerings and revenue models.}},

Title = {{Towards Circular Economy implementation: an agent-based simulation
   approach for business model changes}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces an agent-based approach to study customer behavior
   in terms of their acceptance of new business models in Circular Economy
   (CE) context. In a CE customers are perceived as integral part of the
   business and therefore customer acceptance of new business models
   becomes crucial as it determines the successful implementation of CE.
   However, tools or methods are missing to capture customer behavior to
   assess how customers will react if an organization introduces a new
   business model such as leasing or functional sales. The purpose of this
   research is to bring forward a quantitative analysis tool for
   identifying proper marketing and pricing strategies to obtain best fit
   demand behavior for the chosen new business model. This tool will
   support decision makers in determining the impact of introducing new
   (circular) business models. The model has been developed using an
   agent-based modeling approach which delivers results based on
   socio-demographic factors of a population and customers' relative
   preferences of product attributes price, environmental friendliness and
   service-orientation. The implementation of the model has been tested
   using the practical business example of a washing machine. This research
   presents the first agent-based tool that can assess customer behavior
   and determine whether introduction of new business models will be
   accepted or not and how customer acceptance can be influenced to
   accelerate CE implementation. The tool integrates socio-demographic
   factors, product utility functions, social network structures and
   inter-agent communication in order to comprehensively describe behavior
   on individual customer level. In addition to the tool itself the results
   of this research indicates the need for systematic marketing strategies
   which emphasize CE value propositions in order to accelerate customer
   acceptance and shorten the transition time from linear to circular.
   Agent-based models are emphasized as highly capable to fill the gap
   between diffusion-based penetration of information and resulting
   behavior in the form of purchase decisions.}},

Abstract = {{The recent circular economy movement has raised awareness and interest
   about untapped environmental and economic potential in the manufacturing
   industry. One of the crucial aspects in the implementation of circular
   or closed-loop manufacturing approach is the design of circular
   products. While it is obvious that three post-use strategies, i.e.,
   reuse, remanufacturing, and recycling, are highly relevant to achieve
   loop closure, it is enormously challenging to choose ``the right{''}
   strategy (if at all) during the early design stage and especially at the
   single component level. One reason is that economic and environmental
   impacts of adapting these strategies are not explicit as they vary
   depending on the chosen business model and associated supply chains. In
   this scenario, decision support is essential to motivate adaptation of
   regenerative design strategies. The main purpose of this paper is to
   provide reliable decision support at the intersection of multiple
   lifecycle design and business models in the circular economy context to
   identify effects on cost and CO2 emissions. The development of this work
   consists of a systematic method to quantify design effort for different
   circular design options through a multi-method simulation approach. The
   simulation model combines an agent-based product architecture and a
   discrete event closed-loop supply chain model. Feasibility of the model
   is tested using a case of a washing machine provided by Gorenje d.d.
   Firstly, design efforts for reuse, remanufacturing, and recycling are
   quantified. Secondly, cost and emissions of different design options are
   explored with different business model configurations. Finally, an
   optimization experiment is run to identify the most cost-effective
   combination of reused, remanufactured, and recycled components for a
   business model chosen on the basis of the explorative study results.}},

Abstract = {{Since sustainable consumption (SC) research focuses primarily on
   consumer purchasing behaviors, there is a gap regarding how firms
   attempt to shape sustainable consumption in practice. Utilizing nine
   case studies, this gap is addressed by exploring the use of value
   propositions entailing product-service systems among Swedish fashion
   firms. The value propositions in use by the firms suggest that
   sustainable consumption may be extending beyond purchase to also include
   aspects of use and disposal, suggesting new reciprocal responsibilities
   for firms and consumers. Similarities are found in what elements firms
   incorporate in their value propositions (i.e. more sustainable textiles,
   repair and take-back systems), but differences in how these are
   elaborated, testifying to the inter-organizational dynamics that embed
   practices. The paper ends with the specific caution that take-back
   systems may send illusionary signals regarding recycling that legitimize
   increased consumption and further accelerate material throughput, which
   would be at odds with notions of strong sustainable consumption.

Abstract = {{The business models of digital maker-entrepreneurs in open design are
   inextricably linked to the broader open design community. Digital makers
   share designs on online platforms such as Thingiverse and use digital
   manufacturing technology such as 3-D printing as a generative mechanism
   for their entrepreneurial activities. There is a general understanding
   of how sharing works in that community and the basic design parameters
   that determine the business models of these digital maker-entrepreneurs,
   which are based on a portfolio of activities. This study is based on
   in-depth interviews with 11 digital maker-entrepreneurs from the open
   design community. We investigate the activities that constitute their
   business models using activity theory as a lens with which better to
   understand them. This study provides a perspective on the complexity of
   the relationships in which these activities are embedded and analyzes
   the activities related to the production, distribution, and consumption
   of value. Finally, we examine the exchanges between digital maker
   entrepreneurs in the community, shedding light on how digital
   maker-entrepreneurs share and exchange goods, services, and knowledge as
   peers. (C) 2017 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University. Published

Abstract = {{It is widely recognized that business models can serve as important
   strategic tools in innovation and market formation processes.
   Consequently, business models should have a prominent position in the
   marketing literature. However, marketing scholars have, so far, paid
   little attention to the business model concept, perhaps because it lacks
   an established definition and clear theoretical foundation. This article
   offers a definition for the business model concept that, using a fractal
   approach, connects business models to technological and market
   innovation. Furthermore, the article questions several cornerstone
   strategic concepts by reconceptualizing business model development from
   a firm-centric activity that promotes owning key resources and altering
   sets of decision variables to one that highlights the facilitation of
   broad institutional change processes. As such, it takes the potentially
   controversial position of advocating a service-strategy-based
   understanding of business models for all of marketing strategy.}},

Abstract = {{The UNESCO World Heritage List has been continuously growing since the
   first sites were listed in 1978. It has frequently been highlighted as a
   marker of quality and authenticity, and UNESCO underscores that
   designation is important for tourist visitation. Given the vastness of
   the List, and its expected continued growth, it becomes relevant to
   understand themechanismbywhich UNESCO and the States Parties work to
   promote the dissemination and use of theWorld Heritage brand. This paper
   proposes that the relationship between these entities is best expressed
   through a franchisemodelwherein UNESCO is the franchisor and the States
   Parties franchisees. Therefore, through an analysis of UNESCO World
   Heritage policy and practice documents combinedwith general franchising
   theory, this work seeks to emphasize the appropriateness of this
   business model in understanding the management practices of both UNESCO
   and the States Parties. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Innovation was traditionally protected for its outcome in particular
   under intellectual property laws. However, this approach has gradually
   reached its limit when more innovation needs to be stimulated. Antitrust
   law has thus developed a `process-oriented' protection, despite the fact
   that such a new approach slightly intrudes on the exclusivity of
   property rights. However, less has been discussed so far on how
   anti-unfair competition law has been affected by innovation. Anti-unfair
   Competition law targets conduct that dishonestly takes advantage of
   other competitors, thus traditionally having its core analytical
   framework built upon tort law. While the `outcome-oriented' approach is
   still satisfactory from many perspectives, its drawbacks have been
   extensively revealed with the recent challenge of ad blocking
   applications. At first sight, the traditional approach may be justified.
   However, closer examination unfolds the risk of stifling innovation.
   Therefore, this article advances a new economic interpretation on the
   business model of online media operation, the target of ad blocking
   applications, namely the `combined sale' model vis-vis the traditional
   `single product' model. It is finally concluded that the
   process-oriented approach should prevail over the traditional outcome
   oriented approach where the combined sale model is involved. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{This study intends to examine the xMOOCs offered by one of the
   mainstream MOOC platforms in Conole's 12 dimensions. For this purpose,
   the research employed an embedded single case study using heuristic
   inquiry to collect data. The researchers participated in three xMOOCs
   and took into consideration the characteristics of these MOOCs by rating
   them as low, medium or high in terms of Conole's 12 dimensions.
   Inter-rater reliability was 92 percent. The study showed that the
   openness, massiveness, diversity, use of multimedia, communication among
   learners, learning pathway and amount of reflection dimensions were
   high. The communication with instructors, degree of collaboration and
   autonomy dimensions were medium, and the quality assurance,
   certification, and formal learning dimensions were low. After explaining
   characteristics of xMOOCs from the perspective of open learning, the
   study highlighted that xMOOCs dramatically differ with regard to the
   implementation of the freemium business model to education and course
   delivery methods. It was concluded that MOOCs are not a new form of
   learning, but a new form of organizing learning similar to the open
   university movement, but which promises more flexibility and access than
   open universities.}},

Abstract = {{How will a promising world of 5G influence business model innovation and
   what are the strings attached? The development and innovation of
   business models in a world of 5G is an under-researched field. In the
   `slip stream' of new technologies, which are about to be developed, it
   becomes more and more important to understand how business models
   embedded with persuasive technologies-persuasive business models-are
   going to be innovated and operated. The development of persuasive
   technologies will lead to the exponential increase of persuasive
   business models in the global market. This paper will focus on how to
   overcome security concerns linked to persuasive business models. On
   behalf of the inputs from SW2010-SW2016 (Strategic Workshops held by the
   Centre for Tele-infrastructure, Aalborg University), lab experiments in

Abstract = {{Background: Core laboratory (CL), as a new business model, facilitates
   consolidation and integration of laboratory services to enhance
   efficiency and reduce costs. This study evaluates the impact of total
   laboratory automation system (TLA), electric track vehicle (ETV) system
   and auto-verification (AV) of results on overall turnaround time (TAT)
   (phlebotomy to reporting TAT: PR-TAT) within a CL setting.
   Methods: Mean, median and percentage of outlier (OP) for PR-TAT were
   compared for pre- and post-CL eras using five representative tests based
   on different request priorities. Comparison studies were also carried
   out on the intra-laboratory TAT (in-lab to reporting TAT: IR-TAT) and
   the delivery TAT (phlebotomy to in-lab TAT: PI TAT) to reflect the
   efficiency of the TLA (both before and after introducing result AV) and
   ETV systems respectively.
   Results: Median PR-TATS for the urgent samples were reduced on average
   by 16\% across all representative analytes. Median PR-TATS for the
   routine samples were curtailed by 51\%, 50\%, 49\%, 34\% and 22\% for
   urea, potassium, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), complete blood count
   (CBC) and prothrombin time (PT) respectively. The shorter PR-TAT was
   attributed to a significant reduction of IR-TAT through the TLA.
   However, the median PI-TAT was delayed when the ETV was used.
   Application of various AV rules shortened the median IR-TATs for
   potassium and urea. However, the OP of PR-TAT for the STAT requests
   exceeding 60 min were all higher than those from the pre-CL era.
   Conclusions: TLA and auto-verification rules help to efficiently manage
   substantial volumes of urgent and routine samples. However, the ETV
   application as it stands shows a negative impact on the PR-TAT.}},

Title = {{Pharmacists' perceptions of pay for performance versus fee-for-service
   remuneration for the management of hypertension through pharmacist
   prescribing}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHARMACY PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{5}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Objectives As pharmacists expand their roles as patient care providers,
   remuneration must be offered for patient care activities apart from
   dispensing. Most jurisdictions paying for such services utilize the
   fee-for-service (FFS) model, while little is known about the role of pay
   for performance (P4P) within the pharmacy profession. This study aimed
   to elicit the experience of pharmacists practicing under both models
   within the Alberta Clinical Trial in Optimizing Hypertension (RxACTION)
   study in Alberta, Canada.
   Methods Pharmacist participants in RxACTION caring for at least one
   patient under FFS and under P4P were interviewed about their experiences
   until data saturation was reached. Interviews were conducted in
   June-July 2015, with responses audio recorded, transcribed and coded to
   identify key themes.
   Key findings Eight pharmacists were interviewed, with three key themes
   identified: a perceived comfort with the existing FFS model particularly
   due to its ease related to business planning, the transformative effect
   of the study on their practices and a preference for future models to
   consider a blend of both service count-and performance-driven metrics.
   The degree of influence pharmacists feel they can have on outcomes
   achieved by patients, the perceptions of patients and other healthcare
   professionals on outcome-based payment, and concerns with the impact of
   variable remuneration on the pharmacy business model are concerns raised
   with P4P in pharmacy practice.
   Conclusions This study reveals a hesitation to radically transform
   payment for pharmacists' patient care services towards a P4P model.
   Efforts to implement P4P should therefore be gradual and accompanied
   with a robust evaluation plan.}},

Volume = {{28}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the gap in the knowledge transfer literature around
   how universities choose specific organizational models for their
   knowledge transfer offices (KTOs). Organization theory points towards
   strong interlinkages between strategy, structure and processes in
   organizations. This motivates an exploration of similar links within the
   organizational setup of KTOs. In doing so, the paper provides a unified
   theoretical framework around a university's choice of structure,
   business model and strategic preferences for their KTOs linked to
   university-specific contextual factors. A qualitative approach is used
   wherein four very distinct British universities are examined as
   individual case studies. The authors find that strategic aims of the
   university around practitioner engagement, the quantity of applied
   research and research specialization are key factors in determining the
   organizational characteristics of the KTO. The theoretical framework
   derived from the cases makes two key contributions to the university
   knowledge transfer literature. First, it links the university-level
   contextual factors to the local model of knowledge transfer. Second, it
   allows us to develop a set of generic models of knowledge transfer,
   which can potentially guide universities to develop their own specific
   models.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores how the organizational capabilities of a firm enable
   business model evolution by examining the development of a new firm that
   provides mobile-phone-based information services for farmers in India.
   We argue that these organizational capabilities are part of the dynamic
   capabilities of the firm. We use a longitudinal and in-depth single case
   study to extend our understanding of the mechanism for business model
   evolution in new firms. The study shows three themes emerging from the
   data analysis of the case study by drawing on the literatures on systems
   thinking, dynamic capabilities and business model evolution. The three
   themes are balanced redundancy, requisite variety and cognitive
   discretion, which enable a firm to achieve congruence between the
   components of the business model in order to deliver the customer value
   proposition. We explain how these three micro-foundations of dynamic
   capabilities enable a firm to evolve its business model. We contribute
   to the business model and dynamic capabilities literature by proposing a
   systems perspective on business models and their evolution. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{A fresh agricultural food online exchange system is gradually becoming
   an emerging e-business model in China. However, how and when to make an
   investment in this new business model is risky due to the unique
   characteristics of fresh agricultural food. In this paper, from a third
   party decision maker's perspective, we propose an evolutionary
   discounted cash flow model to investigate the optimum time point for
   investment. Based on the assumptions of base demand, the derived
   e-demand occurring on the pendent e-business system can be characterized
   by non-stationary stochastic processes. Then our new model can further
   be innovatively analyzed by considering the dynamic scheme of the cash
   flow and its evolution. The analytical results suggest the optimal
   investment time point depends upon the consumers' switch rate from the
   physical store to e-store and on the urbanization rate. A Monte Carlo
   simulation is further presented to compare the effects of multiple
   uncertainties embedded into the system. Our uncertainty analysis reveals
   that when government financial support fluctuates greatly, the optimal
   investment time could be either in the very beginning or in the end.
   This optimal time strategy also holds for the random demand factor after
   the coefficient variation of the demand reaches a certain threshold.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Medical regulation is rapidly changing with claims that
   systems such as revalidation/relicensing will reassure the public. Yet
   the impact of such initiatives is unknown.
   Methods: Using the principles of efficiency, calculability,
   predictability and control through technology, identified by Ritzer, and
   exampled by the McDonalds business model, we analyzed interviews with
   doctors between May 2012-Dec 2013 which focused on doctor experiences of
   appraisal and revalidation in SW England.
   Results: The research found significant changes in appraisals since the
   launch of revalidation in December 2012. Appraisal has been standardized
   with a list of supporting information that must be collected by doctors.
   The success of implementation is measured in the numbers of appraisals
   completed but less is known about the quality of the appraisal itself.
   Such efficiencies have been supported by IT systems that themselves
   might be at risk of driving the process.
   Discussion: There are potential advantages to McDonaldization including
   appraisals available to all, not just for doctors working in the NHS,
   and a potentially more appetizing recipe for their completion. As yet a
   state of McAppraisal has not been reached; with a complete transfer of
   trust in the doctor to trust in the appraisal process within
   revalidation. However policymakers will need to continue to ensure that
   regulatory initiatives, such as revalidation, are not just a process for
   their own sake. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Critical factors for viable business models for urban consolidation
   centres}},
Journal = {{RESEARCH IN TRANSPORTATION ECONOMICS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{36-47}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Although urban consolidation centres (UCC) worldwide have improved urban
   freight distribution and reduced externalities, other UCC initiatives
   have not materialised due to problems such as for example, business
   model limitations. All the same, researchers have rarely described
   business model components relevant to city logistics. In response, the
   purpose of this article is to analyse critical factors for viable
   business models of city logistics initiatives involving UCCs. Following
   an extensive literature review and multiple-case study of five
   initiatives with UCCs, we identified seven critical factors of viable
   city logistics business models: the ability to scale up and down the UCC
   solution; an ability to continuously develop and adapt to a dynamic
   environment; the important entrepreneurial role of the initiator as
   well; the acknowledgment of society; ability to innovate new services;
   logistics and supply chain management competence; and the ability to
   take full advantage of advanced IT. All seven factors describe
   continuously redeveloped business models seeking to seize new and
   unexpected opportunities, yet also indicate that city logistics systems
   require local authorities and municipalities to act as initiators,
   enablers, and customers. The models also underscore differences between
   purely commercial and purely municipal city logistics initiatives. (C)

   a focus on addressing the root lifestyle causes of disease. Creating a
   practice in LM comes with an array of challenges. Utilizing different

   insurance, Direct Primary Care model, or concierge systems, allows for
   the incorporation of more LM services and ensures sustainability in the
   practice. One must develop a sound business model and aim to keep costs
   low. Optimizing coding, taking advantage of additional LM services, and
   expanding service formats to group visits or telemedicine are all
   creative ways to incorporate and develop LM practices. Anticipation of
   new challenges and flexibility in practice models and payment systems
   allows one to be successful in starting or transitioning to an LM

Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2017}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Agritourism has achieved a greater importance in the last decade, but
   despite this relevance, the definition is not aligned everywhere,
   depending on the contingency variables of the context in which
   agritourism is located. This paper aims at analyzing the business
   model's key success factors of Italian agritourism by studying their
   structural, social and economic features, integrated with a
   sustainability approach. The empirical analysis is based on a sample of
   agritourism, located in an Italian region. The empirical results show
   relevant and useful elements to support the sustainable development of
   agritourism business models in Italy, linking theory, policy and
   practices. Indeed, these results, together with others related to the
   economic dimension of the farms, their specialization, and the
   characteristics of the farmers make it possible to argue that there are
   common elements, which offer potential for agritourism. In addition, it
   was possible to identify two different models of agritourism.
   Agritourism can open new horizons in rural sustainable development, with
   possible beneficial effects on the environment, society, agricultural
   heritage and economic growth. In particular, regional policy developers
   should take into consideration these elements in order to direct
   correctly efforts. The research shows also some interesting theoretical
   implications as it contributes to enrich the literature on this
   particular kind of business model. At the same time, it helps family
   owners to increase the overall understanding of their agritourism, in
   order to finalize adequate planning and communication.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines how innovations involving big data are helping to
   solve some of the greatest challenges facing the world today. Focusing
   primarily on the developing world, this paper explores how the large
   volumes of digital information, increasingly available in these
   contexts, can help decision-makers better address problems as big as
   poverty, illness, conflict, migration, corruption, natural disasters,
   climate change, and pollution, among other areas. This paper argues that
   the information vacuum that still exists in many developing countries
   makes the potential for impact from big data much greater in these
   contexts. Through a series of case studies, the authors demonstrate how
   big data can be used to address pressing social and environmental
   challenges in developing countries. The authors present research
   questions that could not have been addressed in the absence of dramatic
   recent increases in data volume, variety, and velocity. They then
   extrapolate from these questions, and discuss the nature of the
   technological changes that now allow decision-makers in developing
   countries to leapfrog from data poverty to big data, and permit
   innovative solutions to the aforementioned challenges. The authors
   emphasize the importance of looking beyond the current focus, in the
   literature, on storing, analyzing, and creating commercial value from
   big data. Instead, they point to the importance of innovativeness in
   identifying, integrating, disseminating, and applying new sources of
   data to execute actions that in turn generate product, service, process,
   and business model innovations that are impactful due to big data. The
   authors argue that academic researchers have an important role to play
   in helping the world harness the potential for big data innovations,
   through validation, visualization, and verification of such data.}},

Abstract = {{Social commerce is a new business model of e-commerce, which utilizes of
   Web 2.0 technologies and social media to support social-related exchange
   activities. While its popularity, being a subset of e-commerce, has been
   increasing tremendously since its introduction in 2005, there exists a
   general paucity of research on its framework and its applications'
   effectiveness, especially in areas beyond the common social commerce
   practices. This study develops a comprehensive social commerce framework
   that has four key components: customer, merchant, platform and context.
   Then the study applies the cross-case synthesis technique to analyze the
   usability and generalizability of the framework by applying it to social
   commerce of two (one small and the other global) successful companies.
   We use the negative case analysis approach to assess the importance of
   the new component context by comparing a social commerce failure case
   with the two successful companies. Finally, we introduce a set of
   metrics for social commerce design. The proposed framework and its
   metrics are used to guide the design and evaluation of social commerce.
   This study makes a contribution to the social commerce literature in
   proposing a new design framework and to practice in providing insights
   for effective strategies of the online social business.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines the boundary work done by self-employed men and
   women in rural areas, whose goal is to accomplish their lifestyle
   aspirations. Their business model is to host people, specifically dog
   owners, at their homes, offering a space to spend some leisure time and
   train in dog sports in a rural setting. For the host-entrepreneurs, the
   work is also their lifestyle and, therefore, the conventional boundaries
   between professional and personal life are constantly blurred. The
   article suggests that the emotionally demanding work of crossing the
   boundaries between private and public is motivated by their passion for
   their lifestyle - a desired attribute in the new economy. Although they
   appear to be ideal workers as per the rules of the new economy, the
   business and lifestyle depend on their infinite passion.}},

Abstract = {{The ``Urban Agriculture Europe{''} EU COST-Action (2012-2016) has shown
   that the complexity of urban agriculture (UA) is hardly compressible
   into classic business management models and has proposed new management
   models, such as the Business Model Canvas (BMC). Business models of UA
   have to be different from rural ones. In particular, factors such as
   differentiation and diversification, but also low cost-oriented
   specialisation, are characteristic and necessary business models for UA
   to stay profitable in the long term under challenging city conditions.
   This paper aims to highlight how farm enterprises have to adjust to
   urban conditions by stepping into appropriate business models aiming to
   stay competitive and profitable, and how the BMC is useful to analyse
   their organisation and performance, both economically and socially. The
   paper offers an inter-regional analysis of UA enterprises located in
   Spain, Italy, and Germany, which are further subdivided into: local
   food, leisure, educational, social, therapeutic, agri-environmental,
   cultural heritage and experimental farms. The analysis demonstrates that
   UA is differentially adjusted to specific urban conditions and that the
   BMC is useful for analysing urban farming. Heterogeneous local food
   farms and the integration of local and organic food production in social
   farming business models are most frequent in our case studies.}},

Abstract = {{In recent times, more successful startups, such as Airbnb or Uber, have
   been spurred by business model innovation than by product innovation. I
   tap into the growing stream of research on business models from the
   strategy literature to propose ways in which companies can leverage
   information networks and big data to innovate their current business
   models or to develop new ones. I provide examples on how companies can
   leverage internal and external data to generate new business models and
   I propose a few research questions that can help academics and
   practitioners understand the link between big data and business model
   innovation.}},

Abstract = {{Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) are an important form of hybrid
   organization that may, if properly designed and managed, generate
   innovative solutions to complex problems by combining different
   institutional logics. Using data from a comparative case study of the
   creation of two PPPs in the Italian healthcare sector, we draw on ideas
   from business model design and organizational hybridity to explore how
   complexity can be managed inside PPPs and how this drives the creation
   of value for stakeholders. We link the literature on hybrid
   organizations with the one on business models by looking at the
   organizational mechanisms and processes that are implemented in PPP
   project governance, assets and processes. We go on to develop a
   theoretical model showing how effective business model design can help
   to bridge different logics and create value for stakeholders in the
   creation and operation of PPPs.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY POLICY}},

Abstract = {{Approximately 1.2 billion people lack basic access to electricity. The
   United Nations `Sustainable Energy for All' initiative exemplifies the
   urgent need to address this issue. Recent advancements in photovoltaic,
   light emitting diode and battery technology have resulted in the rise of
   affordable and innovative household electricity technologies, however
   penetration rates remain low due to complexity surrounding `last mile'
   distribution. This paper applies the diffusion of innovations theory as
   a framework to investigate the `last mile' challenges encountered when
   launching a Pay As You Go Solar Home System in a region of Central East
   Africa. The results indicate that Pay As You Go offers the potential to
   deliver a disruptive positive impact with regard to increasing access to
   clean affordable energy for the poor, however, both the technology and
   business model are more complex than current alternatives and therefore
   require a much more developed go-to-market strategy. The cost of
   achieving widespread diffusion is therefore higher than similar products
   sold at retail, yet this is balanced by potential for a much faster rate
   of adoption. Finally, this paper demonstrates the applicability of the
   diffusion of innovations theory as a viable framework for analysing last
   mile challenges associated with Solar Home Systems.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AIR TRANSPORT MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{63}},
Pages = {{119-125}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Since some years ago low-cost carriers (LCCs) are becoming less and less
   low-cost-like, as well as full service airlines are becoming less and
   less full-service-like, thus contributing to lessen the differences
   between users of one airline type and the other. LCCs have made air
   travel available to all budgets and enabled tourists to spend more at
   destination by reallocating their trip expenditure. The objective of
   this article is to observe if airline types have been converging
   regarding travellers' expenditure allocation and total trip expenditure.
   We use repeated cross sections of the Spanish tourist expenditure survey
   between 2006 and 2014, and compositional data analysis with a total in
   order not to confound effects involving expenditure allocation with
   those involving expenditure volume. Results show that users of both
   airline types converge in their allocation of the trip budget (between
   transportation and at-destination expenses, and within at-destination
   expenses), but diverge with regard to total trip expenditure. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{A worldwide trend is leading the international community to explore the
   possible paths for the transition from a linear to a circular economic
   model. Recent studies identified the main enabling factors to facilitate
   this transition, among which closed loop logistics models and new
   service-based and function-oriented business models play a significant
   role. The diffusion of new business models relating to the use of a
   product rather than its ownership can indeed reduce material consumption
   and the related environmental impacts, while customer loyalty and
   company revenues are expected to increase. However, the overall impacts
   of such models on the environmental, economic and social perspectives
   are not clear, as several uncertainty factors arise with the
   implementation of non-ownership models. Therefore, the aim of this work
   is to evaluate impacts on sustainability dimensions due to the
   transition from an ownership-based to a product-as-a-service based model
   in direct and reverse supply chain of a large appliance product, i.e.
   washing machines. The analysis is carried out developing a fuzzy
   cognitive map model to quantify direct and indirect effects on the
   social, economic and environmental dimensions due to the adoption of a
   new business model. First, both the traditional and the leasing supply
   chain models are investigated. Then, the key drivers and their causal
   relationships affecting systems' performance are identified and
   discussed. Results stress out the great potential of such a change in
   the improving of the sustainable dimensions highlighting the enabling
   strategies viable by a policy maker to facilitate the transition to a
   product-as-a-service based model.}},

Abstract = {{Given the complementarity of electricity systems in the north and south
   Mediterranean basin, a greater integration and trade can help achieving
   national and regional energy policy objectives of security of supply,
   cost optimisation and sustainability. However, the issues such as
   different electricity market structures, regulatory and institutional
   diversity and disparate level of political stability make
   interconnection investment between north and south a risky undertaking.
   Due to high perceived risk, delivery of interconnection projects through
   the EU regulated model is less likely, or only possible at prohibitively
   high rate of returns. The merchant transmission initiative (MTI), on the
   other hand, seen as an exception under the EU laws, can be approved only
   if the project meets a set of strict conditions. Here we show that a
   hybrid business model in which the main benefits of a merchant model are
   maintained within a regulated structure, that involves minimal
   regulatory changes to national electricity markets, offers an
   appropriate response to the existing investment challenges in the
   Euro-Mediterranean basin. We highlight the main components of the
   proposed model and show how it addresses the key features of a viable
   business model regarding investment incentives, risks, governance and
   compatibility with the region's energy scenario.}},

Abstract = {{More than 1,180,000 people use several thousand coworking spaces these
   days, but the running of coworking spaces is a rather fragile business
   model. Coworking spaces need entrepreneurial sustainability as well.
   Therefore, this study identifies success factors for sustainable
   business through analysis of users and hosts' demands and priorities
   about coworking spaces. To identify the priorities, we conducted a
   questionnaire survey with 60 hosts and 56 users by using the analytic
   hierarchy process method. We found that hosts thought community and
   communication most important, followed by space and interior, service
   diversity, and price plan, and users considered relationship
   facilitation the most important, followed by service diversity, price
   plan, and networking event and party. After discussions with coworking
   space hosts and users to understand the differences in viewpoints, we
   combined the results to find the highest priorities. Finally, we
   identified relationship facilitation, service diversity, and price plan
   as having the highest priorities for sustainable coworking space
   operation for both sides. This study has major implications for research
   into improving management of coworking spaces as it asks users and hosts
   to select and focus on elements of priority in their decision making for
   entrepreneurial sustainability and management innovation.}},

Title = {{Benchmark Schedules for Subcontracted Operations: Decentralization
   Inefficiencies that Arise from Competition and First-Come-First-Served
   Processing}},
Journal = {{DECISION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{657-690}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Subcontracting has become a prominent business practice across many
   industries. Subcontracting of industrial production is generally based
   on short-term need for additional processing capacity, and is frequently
   employed by manufacturers to process customer orders more quickly than
   using only in-house production. In this article, we study a popular
   business model where multiple manufacturers, each capable of processing
   his entire workload in-house, have the option to subcontract some of
   their operations to a single third party with a flexible resource. Each
   manufacturer can deliver customer orders only after his entire batch of
   jobs, processed in-house and at the third party, is completed. The third
   party facility is available to several manufacturers who compete for its
   use. Current business practice of First-Come-First-Served (FCFS)
   processing of the subcontracted workloads as well as the competitive
   Nash equilibrium schedules developed in earlier studies result in two
   types of inefficiencies; the third party capacity is not maximally
   utilized, and the manufacturers incur decentralization cost. In this
   article, we develop models to assess the value created by coordinating
   the manufacturers' subcontracting decisions by comparing two types of
   centralized control against FCFS and Nash equilibrium schedules. We
   present optimal and/or approximate algorithms to quantify the third
   party underutilization and the manufacturers' decentralization cost. We
   find that both inefficiencies are more severe with competition than they
   are when the third party allocates capacity in an FCFS manner. However,
   in a decentralized setting, a larger percentage of the players prefer
   Nash equilibrium schedules to FCFS schedules. We extend our analysis to
   incomplete information scenarios where manufacturers reveal limited
   demand information, and find that more information dramatically benefits
   the third party and the manufacturers, however, the marginal benefit of
   additional information is decreasing. Finally, we discuss an extension
   wherein each manufacturer's objective takes into account asymmetries in
   subcontracting, in-house processing, and delay costs.}},

Abstract = {{Schools are increasingly involved in diverse forms of student data
   collection. This article provides a sociotechnical survey of a data
   assemblage used in education. ClassDojo is a commercial platform for
   tracking students' behaviour data in classrooms and a social media
   network for connecting teachers, students, and parents. The
   hybridization of for-profit platforms with a key public institution of
   society raises significant issues. ClassDojo is designed to influence
   how school leaders and teachers make decisions, how schools connect with
   parents, and how teachers act to change students' behaviour.
   Conceptualized as a `public sphere platform' ClassDojo is reshaping
   discourses, practices, and subjectivities in schools. In particular,
   ClassDojo provides evidence of how the business model and political
   economy governing social media - `platform capitalism' - is being
   inserted into public education. It is prototypical of education in an
   emerging `platform society', and of how student and teacher
   subjectivities are being reshaped by the presumptions and worldviews
   encoded in digital platforms.}},

Journal = {{INDUSTRIAL MARKETING MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2017}},

Pages = {{57-65}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{This paper elucidates how business-to-business (B2B) small and
   medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) can manage antecedents to the
   application of social media for potential contributions to their
   business. This in-depth qualitative research study was conducted at four
   plastic-producing SMEs from October 2013 to October 2014, with follow-up
   interviews in October 2015.
   The findings reveal two important antecedents to the application of
   social media that overcome the gap between acknowledging the usefulness
   of social media and its actual limited application in practical B2B
   contexts. First, open collaborative business model innovation is needed
   to apply social media in local business processes. Second, central and
   distributed leadership must be integrated to create ownership and
   responsibility across the SME organisation and beyond to customers and
   partners. These findings differ from the social media application stages
   and the gaps between them identified in the previous literature. The
   developed model makes a contribution to the B2B SME field and to
   academia by recognising the importance of integrating critical
   antecedents before social media application can enhance business in B2B
   SMEs. This understanding is beneficial for the B2B SMEs and for society.

Abstract = {{Bestsellers like The Lean Startup and Business Model Generation have
   suggested that ideation the generation and selection of ideas is
   important to new venture creation; yet, little empirical research on the
   topic has been conducted. Using a creative problem-solving approach, we
   developed and tested a new scale that found imaginativeness predicts new
   venture ideation over and above the effects of the usual suspects of
   attitude, knowledge, and evaluation. Imaginativeness is an ideational
   skill that combines task-relevant knowledge in three distinct domains
   creative, social, and practical with the latent ability of imagination.
   In this article, we explain why a new scale was needed, why
   imaginativeness appears to be especially useful to individuals who lack
   entrepreneurial experience, and how imaginativeness enables just about
   anyone to generate and select new venture ideas with the proficiency of
   a habitual entrepreneur. (C) 2017 Kelley School of Business, Indiana

Abstract = {{Enabled by technology, brought into being in response to a crisis in
   scholarly communication, and increasingly driven by governmental
   regulations, mandates of funding bodies, and universities' policies,
   open access (OA) is one of the fundamental issues that need to be
   considered as part of a publishing strategy and business model at a new
   university press. By considering the attitudes toward OA among the
   stakeholders of Australian university presses, I propose that a
   university press should take a hybrid approach to the OA publishing
   model to ensure diversified funding and income streams, editorial
   independence, and sustainability. At the same time, the press needs to
   maintain rigorous peer review, high -quality editing and production, and
   effective marketing while developing a focused publishing program in
   areas that are distinctive to the press and strategically aligned with
   the goals of its parent university.}},

Abstract = {{The activation of the still predominantly passive demand side is
   necessary to further guarantee a stable power system in the short term
   and ensure capacity adequacy in the long run. A system with a high share
   of generators with nearly no marginal costs requires new services that
   facilitate transmitting the right economic signals to the system
   stakeholders. To this end we refine the notion of energy services and
   propose a framework to systematically design quality differentiated
   energy services for consumers. This approach facilitates a value based
   economic assessment of energy services that deviates from the
   marginal-cost-paradigm. We further illustrate pricing options for these
   new energy service products and outline infrastructural needs and
   additional use case-specific product properties. Moreover, we discuss
   how the morphological approach can be formalised using a mathematical
   programming formulation and introduce a complexity measure that
   facilitates assessing potential adoption obstacles for end consumers.
   Additionally, we illustrate the practical applicability of these
   findings by using a prototypical implementation of a decision support
   system. To foster differentiated energy services, we recommend a more
   lenient regulatory regime lowering the barriers for new market entrants.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates how the absorptive capacity of scientific
   spin-offs affects the benefits and challenges of customer involvement in
   the development of radical innovations. We conducted 36 interviews in 3
   spin-offs over 4 years to collect data regarding customer involvement in
   the development of radical innovations. The findings show the importance
   of spin-offs developing both potential and realized absorptive
   capacities to internalize customer knowledge and technology emergence
   awareness and to simultaneously offset customers' lack of technical
   knowledge in formulating their needs. Both market and technical
   knowledge appeared to be important for spin-offs, and these were
   available from both customers and the parent research center. The
   findings' main implication is spin-offs need a blending capability to
   balance between (1) market and technical knowledge, (2) market-pull and
   technology-push approaches, (3) the involvement of customers and parent
   research centers, and (4) potential and realized absorptive capacities.
   This study contributes a conceptual framework on the blending capability
   of customer involvement in the development of radical innovations and a
   set of propositions for future research. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Objectives: The APhA Stakeholder Conference on Improving Patient Access
   to Injectable Medications was convened to foster national dialogue to
   advance the pharmacist's role in the provision of injectable medication
   administration services (MAS) and related patient care services, and to
   establish pharmacy as a site of care for these injections. Participants
   discussed the distinct opportunities to maximize pharmacist scope of
   services, expand patient access to care, improve medication adherence,
   and enhance outcomes for patients on injectable medication therapies for
   a range of conditions. These elements were framed in terms of the
   practice model, the business model, and the necessary training and
   resources to support these activities.
   Data sources: National thought leaders within pharmacy practice,
   pharmacist employers, national pharmacy associations, and pharmaceutical
   companies were invited to participate in the conference on December 15,
   2016. Participants provided perspectives on a series of structured
   questions around administrative and patient care issues associated with
   the expansion of pharmacy-based MAS. Outcomes from the discussions were
   supplemented with related information from the literature.
   Summary: The APhA Stakeholder Conference on Improving Patient Access to
   Injectable Medications explored how the pharmacy profession could
   advance a broad-based, profession-wide practice model for MAS across a
   wide spectrum of therapeutic classes. There is a significant public
   health need to expand access to patients and make MAS a widely
   available, predictable, measurable, and scalable service provided by
   pharmacists. Conference participants discussed scope of practice,
   service delivery, and business model barriers. They also identified
   tools and resources that are necessary to overcome those barriers to
   advance opportunities and develop long-term, sustainable strategies to
   increase access to MAS from community-based pharmacist practitioners.
   Conclusion: Conference outcomes provided specific guidance around the
   need to develop practice support to address public health needs and
   effectively advance pharmacist provision of MAS and related patient care
   services. Key recommendations included the development of national
   practice guidance, standardized education and training, practice-level
   tools and resources, and enhanced technology solutions. (C) 2017

Title = {{Understanding consumer and clinician preferences and decision making for
   rehabilitation following arthroplasty in the private sector}},
Journal = {{BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{JUN 19}},
Abstract = {{Background: To understand private consumer and clinician preferences
   towards different rehabilitation modes following knee or hip
   arthroplasty, and identify factors which influence the chosen
   rehabilitation pathway.
   Methods: Mixed methods cross-sectional study involving 95
   semi-structured interviews of consumers (patients and carers) and
   clinicians (arthroplasty surgeons, physiotherapists and rehabilitation
   physicians) in Sydney, Australia, during 2014-2015. Participants were
   asked about the acceptability of different modes of rehabilitation
   provision, and factors influencing their chosen rehabilitation pathway.
   Interviews were in person or via the telephone. Qualitative analysis
   software was used to electronically manage qualitative data. An
   analytical approach guided data analysis.
   Results: Pre-operative preferences strongly influenced the type of
   rehabilitation chosen by consumers. Key factors that influenced this
   were both intrinsic and extrinsic, including; the previous experience of
   self or known others, the perceived benefits of the chosen mode, a sense
   of entitlement, the role of orthopaedic surgeons and influence of
   patient preference, a patient's clinical status post-surgery, the
   private hospital business model and insurance provider involvement. The
   acceptability of rehabilitation modes varied between clinician groups.
   Conclusions: No one rehabilitation mode provided following arthroplasty
   is singularly preferred by stakeholders. Factors other than the belief
   that a particular mode was more effective than another appear to
   dominate the pathway followed by private arthroplasty consumers,
   indicating evidence-based policies around rehabilitation provision may
   have limited appeal in the private sector.}},

Abstract = {{Recovering nutrients, water and energy from domestic waste streams,
   including wastewater and faecal sludge, is slowly gaining momentum in
   low-income countries. Resource recovery and reuse (RRR) offers value
   beyond environmental benefits through cost recovery. An expected game
   changer in sanitation service provision is a business model where
   benefits accrued via RRR can support upstream sanitation services
   despite the multitude of private and public stakeholders involved from
   waste collection to treatment. This paper shows options of how resource
   recovery and reuse can be an incentive for the sustainable sanitation
   service chain, by recovering costs where revenue can feed back
   internally or using generated revenues from reuse to fill financial gaps
   across the service chain to complement other supporting mechanisms for
   making waste management more attractive.}},

Abstract = {{Chain-wide traceability systems conforming to the Electronic Product
   Code Information Services (EPCIS) standard which is a well-recognized
   global standard allow supply chain operators to digitally capture and
   directly access the traceability data within and across enterprises.
   Although recent studies proposed the cloud-based deployment of
   EPCIS-based traceability systems by which supply chain operators are
   likely to save their investment cost in IT infrastructure, resource
   utilization remains a major concern in cloud based deployment and those
   systems are required to deliver, optimal performance. In this research,
   we propose the RESTful Economic-Aggregating Discovery Service (RECO-ADS)
   model to improve the cost effectiveness of resource use of the EPCIS
   system, which runs in the cloud. In the proposed model, we select the
   ADS model as the query traceability data approach. We design the
   internal and centralized traceability systems to comply with the EPCIS
   specification and Electronic Product Code Discovery Service (EPCDS)
   deployed to the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud business model.
   Moreover, we integrate the RESTful web service with the Interfaces of
   EPCIS and EPCDS traceability systems. The evaluation criteria to measure
   resource efficiency, including computing resources, data transfers, and
   response time, are provided. The RECO-ADS is compared with the
   conventional traceability models, Directory Service (DS), Query Relay
   (QR) and Aggregating Discovery Service (ADS), using the evaluation
   criteria. The comparison shows that the computing resources, which
   consist of the CPU and Memory percentages of EPCIS and EPCDS systems,
   are rather similar, whereas the total data transfer (kB/s) of RECO-ADS
   (661.97) was less than that of the DS (807.73), QR (794.80) and ADS
   (796.66) models by approximately 18.05\%, 16.71\%, and 16.91\%,
   respectively. The response time of the RECO-ADS model was the shortest.
   Moreover, the design of the cache in the EPCDS repository in the
   RECO-ADS model yielded a reduced operational cost based on the
   performance evaluation. These findings improve on the cost-effective
   resource consumption in the IaaS cloud of not only the EPCIS system but
   also the EPCDS system. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive communication model perform the investigation and surveillance
   of spectrum in cognitive radio networks abetment in advertent primary
   users (PUs) and in turn help in allocation of transmission space for
   secondary users (SUs). In effective performance of regulation of
   wireless channel handover strategy in cognitive computing systems, new
   computing models are desired in operating set of tasks to process
   business model, and interact naturally with humans or machine rather
   being programmed. Cognitive wireless network are trained via artificial
   intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms for dynamic
   processing of spectrum handovers. They assist human experts in making
   enhanced decisions by penetrating into the complexity of the handovers.
   This paper focuses on learning and reasoning features of cognitive radio
   (CR) by analyzing primary user (PU) and secondary user (SU) data
   communication using home location register (HLR) and visitor location
   register (VLR) database respectively. The SpecPSO is proposed for
   optimizing handovers using supervised machine learning technique for
   performing dynamic handover by adapting to the environment and make
   smart decisions compared to the traditional cooperative spectrum sensing

Abstract = {{Based on interviews and two workshops with the main stakeholders aswell
   as media coverage, this article analyses the changes in the market from
   the deregulation leading up to the Swedish market exit of CargoNet, the
   former monopolist provider of intermodal freight transport, and the
   events that followed. The analysis applies business model theory. When
   CargoNet left the Swedish market in April 2012, some of the traffic was
   absorbed by other intermodal providers and the wagon load rail system.
   The routes to the far north of Sweden, however, were assuming an
   infrastructure role for the main forwarders and road hauliers, who
   formed the joint venture Real Rail with CargoNet to continue traffic.
   The business model applied by Real Rail differed from CargoNet's and
   other intermodal providers, mainly by the tight connection to the
   customers, who guaranteed volumes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The business model (BM) - a representation of a venture's core logic for
   creating value - is an emergent construct of interest in social
   entrepreneurship research. While the BM concept is normally associated
   with financial objectives, socio-entrepreneurial BMs are uniquely
   identifiable by their social value propositions, by their intended
   target markets and by the projected social change. Drawing from a
   longitudinal case study of a Colombian foundation, we outline the
   characteristics of socio-entrepreneurial BMs. We analyse the
   entrepreneurial process behind the implementation of a BM that draws on
   communitarian innovative solutions that benefit the excluded and,
   ultimately, society at large. Focusing on the question of how
   socio-entrepreneurial BMs progressively evolve to produce social change,
   we examine the BM of a successful socio-entrepreneurial venture that
   exhibits the conditions of social change. Our findings show that the
   social value proposition, the entrepreneur's passion for social change
   and a community-based network are decisive factors.}},

   and to analyze the development and evolution of a latest hot area,
   business model. A dataset of 1498 records published between 1995 and
   2015 is collected from Web of Science database. The empirical results
   show the latest hot topics in the business model study focus on business
   model innovation and value creation. In addition, technology oriented
   articles and strategy oriented articles provide some of the main
   perspectives of business model study. The conclusions and implications

Abstract = {{Currently, industry is showing increasing interest in performance-based
   business models. Functional Products is one such business model, where
   the provider offers a function to customers at an agreedupon level of
   availability, productivity or efficiency, etc. A Functional Product
   comprises the following four main constituents: hardware, software,
   service support system and management of operation, which together
   deliver value to customers on a long-term basis. This paper, based on
   empirical data, provides an outline and starts the verification of a
   proposed overall Functional Product lifecycle combining and coordinating
   its economic-and technical perspectives. The perspectives are combined
   and the key aspects of the necessary coordination between and within the
   perspectives, i.e., sustainable win-win situations and coordination of
   sub-lifecycles for the economic perspective, and the need for
   coordination between the Functional Products' technical perspective's
   four sub-lifecycles (hardware, software, service-support system and
   management of operation), are elaborated and discussed. Further,
   addition of new functionality, contract management, and long-term
   management of operation are discussed in the light of managing
   fleets/individual customers, assets and availability. The proposed
   overall Functional Product lifecycle is further analyzed from a number
   of views and aspects. (C) 2016 CIRP.}},

Abstract = {{Universal coverage and financial sustainability are two competing aims
   in primary care. Patient empowerment and patient engagement have been
   suggested as essential ingredients of the recipe for innovative primary
   care models aimed at sustaining universal coverage. Concierge medicine
   is achieving a growing popularity among both scholars and practitioners
   as a direct primary care practice which allows to bridge the gap between
   patient empowerment and patient engagement. However, ethical and legal
   concerns hinder the diffusion of concierge models in the current primary
   care practices. This manuscript is aimed at providing an evidence
   synthesis of extant contributions in the field of concierge medicine in
   order to discuss its attributes and to examine its expected effects on
   universal coverage and sustainability. For this purpose, a systematic
   literature review involving 29 manuscripts was performed. The findings
   of this study pointed out that concierge models could play a significant
   role in enhancing the access to primary care and in improving the
   sustainability of the healthcare service system. However, the existing
   institutional arrangements which regulate the access to primary care
   should be revised to allow more spaces for the implementation of
   concierge practices.}},

Abstract = {{Within the United Kingdom (UK), assisted living technologies are mostly
   provided through statutory health and social care services following
   assessment of individual need and application of eligibility criteria.
   This paper describes the first UK study to explore and develop business
   approaches and innovations required to make electronic assisted living
   technologies more accessible to consumers in their fifties and sixties.
   A robust mixed-method approach was used including a large sample size
   for a consumer survey, triangulation of methods and confirmation of
   research findings through validation workshops. This three-year study
   makes significant and original contributions to understanding consumer
   needs in this rapidly changing market and offers unique insights into
   the needs and wants of people aged 50-70. Analysis shows significant
   differences between consumer and business perceptions, indicating that
   marketing is not closely aligned to consumers' needs and is affecting
   the development of the market. New approaches to consumer-led business
   models are presented to improve information and marketing aimed at
   50-70-year-old consumers. A Broker/Independent Advisor' business model
   showed most potential for meeting the needs of both consumer and
   business stakeholders. Findings support future development of an
   assisted living consumer market to meet growing levels of need and
   demand, and to offer greater consumer choice of mainstream technologies
   to enable people to age in place.}},

Abstract = {{This empirical study argues that the time is ripe for the commercial
   banks, non-profit microfinance organizations and venture capitalists to
   seek out initiatives to step up their efforts to serve small and medium
   enterprises (SMEs) in Saudi Arabia. The collapse and dependency
   exacerbate the sustainability of the SMEs on of oil prices in Saudi
   Arabia. This empirical study has taken to address the growth
   opportunities, challenges, and strategic options that hampered the
   sustainability and evolution of SMEs in Saudi Arabia. The researcher
   conducted twenty-one focus interviews with Saudi entrepreneurs to learn
   about the challenges and the impact of objectivity and correctness of
   initiatives to SMEs sustainability and growth. The study used the
   hermeneutic technique, to analyze the transcriptions of the recorded
   interviews, which employs a part-to-whole mode of interpretation. This
   method helped the researcher to understand the entrepreneur's view and
   put aside his assumptions about a situation or experience. The themes
   that surfaced from the twenty-one interviews; financial support \&
   partnerships, labor laws and best practices, and technologically

Abstract = {{Although the paradox perspective is gaining increasing attention among
   management scholars, most of us continue to struggle with addressing
   this challenging topic in the classroom, as it seems out of reach for
   many students. In this article, we describe a potentially beneficial way
   to approach paradoxical thinking in management education: teaching the
   cooperative business model. Cooperatives are user-owned,
   user-controlled, and user-benefitting enterprises that operate in the
   world's most competitive economies and sectors of activity,
   demonstrating strong resilience in periods of turbulence and crisis. We
   argue that, despite the absence of the cooperative business model in
   mainstream management textbooks and curricula, this model can offer a
   high pedagogical value for management education in that it can foster
   paradoxical thinking. To support this claim, we first demonstrate how
   the cooperative business model is characterized by inherent paradoxes
   that are more salient and inescapable than they might be in conventional
   corporations, thus generating tension-filled material for student
   engagement. Second, we share experiential pedagogical tools and suggest
   potential learning outcomes. Finally, we discuss some practical
   implications for integrating cooperatives and other alternative
   organizations in mainstream management education curricula to help
   develop paradoxical thinking.}},

Abstract = {{We estimate economies of scale and scope as well as cost and revenue
   efficiency to explain the structure of the global reinsurance market,
   where large reinsurers dominate but both diversified and specialized
   reinsurers are competitive. The costs and benefits of size and product
   diversification are particularly relevant to the reinsurance industry,
   as risk diversification is central to the industry's business model. We
   find that reinsurers with total assets less than USD 2.9 billion exhibit
   scale economies, while those with total assets greater than USD 15.5
   billion do not. Large reinsurers are characterized by high cost
   efficiency, while small reinsurers exhibit superior efficiency only when
   specialized. Large reinsurers also exhibit revenue scope economies when
   operating both life and nonlife reinsurance. Moreover, the evidence is
   in line with the efficient structure hypothesis: cost-efficient
   reinsurers can charge lower prices without sacrificing profitability.

Title = {{The Concept of Fairness: Linking EU Competition and Data Protection Law
   in the Digital Marketplace}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN LAW REVIEW}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{42}},

Pages = {{210-233}},

Abstract = {{In the rapidly proliferating digital marketplace, the business model of
   numerous companies is based on the processing of vast amounts of
   personal data. The data economy has triggered controversies regarding
   the intersection between EU competition law and data protection law.
   This article embarks on a conceptual analysis of ``fairness{''}, and
   tests the hypothesis that there exist commonalities between the two
   fields of law. The hypothesis is based on the fact that both competition
   and data protection law make explicit reference to the concept of
   fairness in defining infringements, and that EU law in general terms is
   subordinate to the principle of coherence. The article concludes,
   however, that although the concept is, to some extent, applied
   coherently in the two fields, its ability to offer legal certainty for
   the actors in the digital economy remains limited unless and until the
   administrative and judicial authorities elaborate its precise contents
   more fully. A joint elaboration could offer opportunities to move from
   ``deliberate isolation{''} towards ``constructive coherence{''}.}},

Abstract = {{We develop an econometric model to analyze the real-life impact of two
   robust scheduling approaches, namely limiting hub connectivity and
   implementing swap opportunities, based on a broad dataset of the U.S.
   domestic market. Our analysis is from a novel aircraft routing
   perspective. We confirm a delay-driving effect of direct hub
   connectivity and a delay-reducing effect of swap opportunities. Indirect
   hub connectivity provides airlines with another approach to limit
   delays. We furthermore contrast that the business model of Southwest
   Airlines cannot leverage the delay-reducing effects resulting from swap
   opportunities. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},

Volume = {{385}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Web tracking is the key enabling technology of modern online advertising
   and, at the same time, the source of serious privacy concerns. In recent
   years, we have witnessed the emergence of a variety of technologies
   whose main goal is to address these concerns. However, ad blockers and
   anti-trackers eliminate all forms of tracking and advertising and
   therefore fail to reconcile user privacy and the current Internet
   business model.
   In this paper, we propose a new tracking paradigm that aims at returning
   control to users over tracking and advertising, and allowing them to
   participate in the monetization of their browsing data. The proposed
   paradigm breaks with the current barter model of exchanging privacy for
   services and, at the same time, it may preserve the Internet economic
   model where content is paid from advertisement revenue. We have designed
   a system architecture that implements this model in practice, and
   optimizes the exchange of privacy for money. Our ultimate aim is to
   strike a better balance between user privacy and the economic model that
   sustains the Web, and thus overcome the deadlock caused by the ad
   blocking wars. Experimental results with real browsing data demonstrate
   the suitability and feasibility of our approach. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{A cross-sectional survey of 445 Village Animal Health Workers (VAHWs)
   from 19 provinces in Cambodia was undertaken. The aim was to establish
   their levels of training, farm visit frequency, reasons for visits and
   disease reporting practices, enabling the strengths and weaknesses of
   the VAHW system in Cambodia to be determined, in providing both a
   fee-based smallholder livestock clinical service and a government
   partnership in transboundary animal disease (TAD) surveillance and
   control. The study used `guided group interviews' and identified that
   VAHWs had good contact with farmers with 61.5\% making more than one
   farm visit daily. However, incomes from services remained low, with 45\%
   VAHWs obtaining between 20 and 40\% of their household income from VAHW
   activities. VAHWs recorded relatively high rates of disease reporting,
   with 72\% claiming they report diseases immediately and 74\% undertaking
   monthly reporting to veterinary authorities. Logistic regression
   analysis revealed VAHW contact frequency with district and/ or
   provincial officers was associated with more VAHW farm visits, and
   frequency of VAHW visits to smallholder farms was positively associated
   with average monthly expenditure on animal medication and equipment.
   This suggests that increased veterinary extension to VAHWs and access to
   veterinary equipment, vaccines and drugs may further increase
   VAHW-farmer engagement. VAHWs provide an accessible, market-based,
   animal health `treatment and reporting' service linked to livestock
   smallholders across Cambodia. However, for improved TAD prevention and
   more efficient control of outbreaks, research that assesses provision of
   an animal health `preventive-based' business model is urgently needed to
   reduce both the costs to farmers and the risks to the economy due to
   foot-and-mouth disease and other TADs in Cambodia.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the structure of profit-sharing schemes and
   performance incentives within accounting firms. Accounting firms have a
   strong historical tradition of professionalism but they are also
   commercial entities. In particular, the audit function within accounting
   firms serves an important public interest role. Profit-sharing schemes
   and performance incentives play a valuable role in managing the tension
   between commercialism and professionalism. Interviews with partners from
   all Big 4 firms and four mid-tier firms were conducted to gain insights
   into details of the firms' profit-sharing schemes and performance
   incentives. We found that the Big 4 firms have established sophisticated
   commercial performance measurement systems in an attempt to accurately
   measure the contributions of individual partners, and a number of these
   metrics are nonfinancial in nature. The range of partner salaries within
   firms has increased significantly in recent years, providing a further
   reason for a greater focus on measuring performance. From our sample of
   mid-tier firms we found a trend toward similar profit-sharing and
   performance incentives as currently exist within the Big 4, suggesting
   mid-tier firms are also moving toward a more commercial business model.}},

Abstract = {{The business model applied to the fresh tomato trade from Almeria is
   well known in Spain and abroad. The changes in demand are forcing export
   companies to change their trade strategies to become or remain
   competitive. The purpose of this paper is to know the business structure
   and its export dynamics in addition to the changes in trade strategies
   made by companies in Almeria during the 2009-2013 period. The
   methodology is based on the Herfindahl-Hirshmanindex and the foreign
   trade competitiveness index, whereas the congruence analysis is based on
   Pearson's correlation coefficients and the RV coefficient. We have also
   applied the dual multiple factor analysis to verify changes made to the
   trade policy in leading businesses between two periods or scenarios. The
   research shows that export-driven companies behave as a moderately
   concentrated structure and there is an increase in the number of
   exporters. The competitiveness map for Almeria reveals the sector's
   trend with regard to the most important markets. We have verified the
   changes made to their trade strategy to adjust to changes in foreign
   trade between the 2008/09 and 2012/13 campaigns. Finally, it can be
   pointed out that, in the analyzed period, changes in the business model
   for fresh tomato trade of Almeria have not been significant, being its
   structure of moderate concentration. In addition, the great majority of
   variations in strategies of companies to adapt to the competitive
   environment have been made by leading companies.}},

Abstract = {{Wal-Mart's failed entry into the German retail market represents a
   puzzle for theories of globalization, which assert that more efficient
   producers will drive out poorly performing competitors, producing
   profits for themselves and gains for consumers. Wal-Mart's ability to
   dominate its input network and to provide low-cost leadership through
   lean production has often been seen as the global example of creating
   efficiencies in the retail sector. In 2006, however Wal-Mart abandoned
   an eight-year effort to become a dominant player in Germany's retail
   market. I argue that efficiency is not absolute, but rather
   context-specific and socially constructed. Domestic culture and
   institutions interact to constrain convergence towards a single business
   model in the retail sector. In the end, it was not the rigidity of
   German market conditions-such as high labor costs or union power-that
   led to failure, but rather the inflexibility of Wal-Mart's strategy in
   coping with complex local conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Empowered by information and communication technologies (ICT) analytics
   and smart technologies, the energy model landscape is changing with
   flexibility at the core of a new energy market design. In particular,
   multi-sided platforms (MSPs) has gained prominent attention as a
   business model that creates value by enabling direct interactions
   between several distinct groups of actors who need each other in order
   to deliver products to their customers. However, as MSPs are less
   familiar within the energy market, there has been little investigation
   in modelling this emerging and dynamic ecosystem. Utilising the business
   modelling methodology of value network analysis and the key informant
   technique, value flows were modelled within the context of a MSP to
   understand the creation, delivery and capture of value in a network of
   interdependent relationship, its networked position and the stakeholder
   interactions required for delivery of local flexibility. Supported by
   this analysis, this paper focuses on the LV area of the smart grid, and
   presents the Local Flexibility Market (LFM) as a MultiSided Plarform. In
   comparison to the traditional utility model, the complexity of this
   recharacterization of the industry ecosystem is significant. While it
   presents new opportunities for incumbent energy providers to collaborate
   and develop new products, the proposed LFM market design will also
   dramatically reshape the value model of the industry.}},

Abstract = {{The Internet environment has led to selection mechanisms for products
   that are very fast, with the elimination of competitors that do not have
   an appropriate business model. To this end, it is essential to refer to
   an active and interactive model of web presence that consider he
   specificity of italian agrifood products and their local dimension, in
   order to generate a real source of competitive advantage in a global
   context. In the Italian agrifood economy, since the 90's many companies
   have implemented new ``e-business{''} and web marketing organisational
   models, to adapt to the new competitive environment. They have adopted
   new strategic tools for market knowledge, brand awareness of their
   product, and customer.
   The last frontiers are represented by social commerce, Apps, mobile and
   content marketing, to name just a few (Liang et al. 2011; Scuderi et al.
   2014). The new ``e-commerce{''} frontier is represented by logistics
   adaptations for sale at Km zero of fresh products and same-day delivery.
   Amazon Prime Now, which provides for the delivery in an hour in some
   urban areas of the United States, is the most prominent example, but
   there are other examples of the marketplace in several European
   countries. In Italy several e-commerce operators have equipped with
   their own logistics for same-day delivery or have adopted the model{''}
   click-and-collect{''} (buy on line and pick up the goods at a gathering
   place of the seller).
   The aim of the paper is to draw a picture of the online sales models of
   fresh fruit and vegetables in Italy and the presence of marketplace, to
   identify the limits and opportunities of the growing phenomenon of
   Amazon Prime Now, through a methodology of Word of Mouth and among
   consumers concerning purchase trend of other ones (Brown et al. 2007;
   Brush et al. 2010).}},

Abstract = {{As a new form of distributed energy resources, massive plug-in hybrid
   electric vehicles (PHEVs) could affect the power distribution system
   adequacy considering their intermittent charging loads and the load
   recovery ability during system outages. This paper proposes a
   comprehensive framework for adequacy evaluation of power distribution
   networks with PHEVs penetration. A condition-dependent outage model is
   used in this paper to obtain the time sequential failure rate of the
   transformer. Also, a business model for the PHEVs is developed to
   encourage the PHEV owners to charge their vehicles in such a way that
   the distribution system adequacy is enhanced. Based on this model, a
   smart charging algorithm is proposed for the PHEVs to minimize their
   charging cost and enhance the adequacy of the distribution network at
   the same time. Various simulation studies are carried out to verify the
   effectiveness of the proposed smart charging approach. The simulation
   results show that the proposed approach is effective in enhancing both
   the adequacy of the distribution network and economic profits of PHEVs.}},

Title = {{Analysis of economically viable lignin-based biorefinery strategies
   implemented within a kraft pulp mill}},
Journal = {{TAPPI JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{157-169}},

Abstract = {{Many pulp and paper companies are considering implementing a
   lignin-based biorefinery to diversify their core business to new
   products and improve their longer-term competitiveness. The best
   strategy to achieve might not be obvious, considering the lignin
   extraction process and derivatives to be implemented over the longer
   term that meet market and business objectives, and provide competitive
   advantage. In this article, various lignin biorefinery strategies were
   considered in a case study involving lignin precipitation processes
   integrated within an existing kraft mill, and solvent pulping processes
   that would be implemented in parallel to the existing mill processes
   using additional hardwood. The analysis aimed to identify the conditions
   under which various strategies would represent suitable investments.
   Operating constraints in the case study mill limited lignin extraction
   to 85 metric tons/day from 15\% of the mill's black liquor, whereas 260
   metric tons/day lignin could be extracted by solvent pulping 1500 metric
   tons/day of hardwood. The preferred strategies identified by the study
   were lignin precipitation to phenolic resins production, and solvent
   pulping to carbon fiber production. The first product-process strategy
   requires lower investment, provides high returns (internal rate of
   return {[}IRR] of 39\% to 43\%), and is more easily implemented in the
   near term. Solvent pulping resulted in reasonable profitability (IRR of
   18\% to 25\%), with higher production volumes and a diversified product
   portfolio, and was considered more suitable as a longer-term strategy.
   Business model robustness and long-term competitiveness can be better
   assured by combining both strategies. It was shown that 1) government
   support to offset capital cost, and 2) high derivatives market prices
   positively influence lignin valorization strategies, which are sensitive
   to technology and market maturity.
   Application: This study illustrates how a technical and economic
   analysis could be used to identify lignin-based biorefinery strategies
   that represent an attractive investment.}},

   beneficiaryrun organisations on the model of the John Lewis Partnership

Abstract = {{Online entertainment shopping has emerged as an innovative business
   model, integrating features of electronic commerce, auctions, games, and
   lotteries. Prior literature has rarely provided an understanding of the
   effects of electronic market factors on players' bidding performance in
   entertainment shopping. We attempt to fill this research gap by
   analyzing how players' bidding patterns and characteristics can affect
   bidding performance. An empirical study with 5650 players' participation
   data collected from a leading entertainment shopping website is
   conducted. Results confirm that players' bidding performance, including
   profit earning and monetary loss bidding, is strongly associated with
   bidding patterns and characteristics. Based on empirical findings,
   players loyal to the website contribute more profit to the website. The
   website should pay more attention to loyal players and strategically
   limit players that are good at bidding, in order to avoid losing and
   winning polarizations. Furthermore, players with different product
   preferences have different weights for profit and entertainment, and
   player preferences can be transformed into monetary value for the
   website.}},

   introduction of Structural Adjustment Programs (SAPs) in developing

   It examines how market approaches attempt to tackle socio-economic
   challenges and include low-income communities in business chains. It
   introduces the concept of Comprehensive Inclusive Business Model
   indicators and elaborates its parameters from an inclusive development
   perspective. Even though existing inclusive business models focus on
   social inclusiveness through emphasizing human dignity, rights and
   economic sustainability, there is less emphasis on environmental or

Journal = {{INDUSTRIAL MARKETING MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{61}},
Pages = {{67-80}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the role of proximity in designing business models
   that work for those at the BoP. BoP markets represent an extreme setting
   where actors struggle to access and organise limited resources and
   develop appropriate socio-economic-political practices. Drawing on
   Boschma's (2005) concept of proximity, we analyse three historical cases
   of business at the BoP to uncover the spatial-temporal dimensions of
   business model design in practice. Findings suggest that 1) business
   model design practices iteratively structure connections with markets
   and open up new spaces for market activity. This means that business
   models are necessarily understood as plastic and continuously
   in-the-making; 2) by taking into account the stability and change of
   proximity dimensions and the dynamics between them as they relate to
   business activities, managers are better equipped to identity
   opportunities that create, shape and connect with markets; and 3) the
   spatial-temporal dynamic of the business model proximities framework
   reveals that some proximities strengthen others through time, with
   negative and positive consequences. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published

Abstract = {{Expansion by photovoltaic (PV) technologies in the renewable energy
   market requires exploring added value integrated with business model
   innovation. In recent years, a pilot trial of PV water pumping (PVWP)
   technologies for the conservation of grassland and farmland has been
   conducted in China. In this paper, we studied the added value of the
   PVWP technologies with an emphasis on the integration of the value
   proposition with the operation system and customer segmentation. Using
   the widely used existing PV business models (PV-roof) as a reference, we
   evaluated discounted cash flow (DCF) and net present value (NPV) under
   the scenarios of traditional PV roof, PVWP pilot, PVWP scale-up, and
   PVWP social network, where further added value via social network was
   included in the business model. The results show that the integrated
   PVWP system with social network products significantly improves the
   performance in areas such as the discounted payback period, internal
   rate of return (IRR), and return on investment (ROI). We conclude that
   scenario PVWP social network with business model innovation, can result
   in value add ins, new sources of revenue, and market incentives. The
   paper also suggests that current policy incentives for PV industry are
   not efficient due to a limited source of revenue, and complex procedures
   of feed-in tariff verification. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Cloud computing is a fast-growing and promising technology segment that
   aims to reduce maintenance and management costs by shifting high-quality
   computing infrastructure to the Internet. It is emerging as a dominant
   technology because it provides an on-demand, self-service, scalable, and
   pay-per-use business model. Despite its numerous benefits, it suffers
   from several security challenges. As a consequence of on-demand service,
   availability of computing resources is the crucial attribute of cloud
   computing among security necessities. In this work, a survey is
   presented on various issues related to the availability of resources in
   a cloud environment. Ensuring availability and security of
   computing/storage resources are still challenging tasks. The adversary
   class readily exploits the vulnerabilities in the cloud infrastructure
   for attack implementation. The article presents a study of various
   categories of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks in cloud
   computing and their defense mechanisms. It is believed that this is the
   first work which surveys all varieties of DDoS attacks in the cloud
   environment.}},

   will suffice the long-term survival of the institution. Moreover,
   regression analysis is also employed to examine the impacts of financial
   outreach on the Nigerian economic growth.
   Findings - The authors find that Islamic moral transaction mode will
   moderate the sustainable Islamic banking business which can influence
   the sustenance of IMFBs and the well-being of the society through
   financial outreach.
   Research limitations/implications - The paper has empirically tested the
   impact of financial outreach on growth, and suggested future studies to
   investigate the existing relationships among the proposed model
   components. Therefore, further studies have the opportunity to develop
   measurements that will guide in testing the model, as well as
   strengthening its components.
   Practical implications - Implementing this model will enhance the
   sustainability of IMFBs and socioeconomic well-being of the society
   through financial outreach. Consequently, this study also suggests other
   policy measures that will improve the sustenance of IMFBs and the
   society as a whole.
   Originality/value - The paper contributes to the existing literature of
   microfinance banks by linking the components of the sustainable business
   model to primary evidence of Sharia coupled with an in-depth link to
   generosity.}},

Title = {{An enquiry into potential graduate entrepreneurship Is higher education
   turning off the pipeline of graduate entrepreneurs?}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{743-760}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - In today's global economy, high in talent but low in growth,
   the capability and skills mismatch between the output of universities
   and the demands of business has escalated to a worrying extent for
   graduates. Increasingly, university students are considering
   alternatives to a lifetime of employment, including their own start-up,
   and becoming an entrepreneur. The literature indicates a significant
   disconnect between the role and value of education and healthy
   enterprising economies, with many less-educated economies growing faster
   than more knowledgeable ones. Moreover, theory concerning the
   entrepreneurial pipeline and entrepreneurial ecosystems is applied to
   graduate entrepreneurial intentions and aspirations. The paper aims to
   discuss these issues.
   Design/methodology/approach - Using a large-scale online quantitative
   survey, this study explores graduate `'entrepreneurial intention{''} in
   the UK and France, taking into consideration personal, social and
   situational factors. The results point to a number of factors that
   contribute to entrepreneurial intention including social background,
   parental occupation, gender, subject of study and nationality. The study
   furthers the understanding of and contributes to the extant literature
   on graduate entrepreneurship. It provides an original insight into a
   topical and contemporary issue, raising a number of research questions
   for future study.
   Findings - For too long, students have been educated to be employees,
   not entrepreneurs. The study points strongly to the fact that today's
   students have both willingness and intention to become entrepreneurs.
   However, the range of pedagogical and curriculum content does not
   correspond with the ambition of those who wish to develop
   entrepreneurial skills. There is an urgent need for directors of higher
   education and pedagogues to rethink their education offer in order to
   create a generation of entrepreneurs for tomorrow's business world. The
   challenge will be to integrate two key considerations: how to create a
   business idea and how to make it happen practically and theoretically.
   Clearly, change in the education product will necessitate change in the
   HE business model.
   Research limitations/implications - The data set collected was extensive
   (c3500), with a focus on France and the UK. More business, engineering
   and technology students completed the survey than others. Further
   research is being undertaken to look at other countries (and continents)
   to test the value of extrapolation of findings. Initial results parallel
   those described in this paper.
   Practical implications - Some things can be taught, others need
   nurturing. Entrepreneurship involves a complex set of processes which
   engender individual development, and are highly personalised. Higher
   Education Enterprise and Teaching and Learning Strategies need to be
   cognisant of this, and to develop innovative and appropriate curricula,
   including assessment, which reflects the importance of the process as
   much as that of the destination.
   Social implications - The global economy, propelled by the push and pull
   of technology, is changing at a speed never before seen. This is having
   profound political, social and economic effects which necessitate
   fundamental change that we organise ourselves and our activities.
   Current models and modus operandi are proving increasingly unfit for
   purpose. Nurturing and encouraging agile mindsets, creativity,
   supporting the testing of new ideas and ways of doing things and
   adapting/adopting to innovation are all critical future employability
   factors. Our future prosperity and well-being will be dependent on
   creating new learning models.
   Originality/value - This work builds on an extensive literature review
   coupled with original primary research. The authors originate from a
   variety of backgrounds and disciplines, and the result is a very
   challenging set of thoughts, comments and suggestions that are relevant
   to all higher education institutions, at policy, strategy and
   operational levels.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims to investigate how network forms of organising,
   information technology-enabled solutions, as well as their institutional
   context, co-evolve in social entrepreneurship. The results of an
   in-depth longitudinal study on a food donation organisation suggest
   that: 1) social entrepreneurship manifests itself through a
   network-shaped organisational form, which is mainly expected to catalyse
   the transformation of externalities into successfully manageable commons
   for societal benefit; 2) social entrepreneurship evolves dynamically
   through specific organisational features and success factors, which are
   effectively understandable by leveraging the joint explanatory power of
   the theory of the commons and the theory of sustainability transitions;
   3) these theories also provide sound conceptual tools to explain how
   information and communication technologies (ICTs) co-evolve with the
   social entrepreneurship organisation, its business model, and the
   institutional context.}},

Abstract = {{Enterprise models assist the governance and transformation of
   organizations through the specification, communication and analysis of
   strategy, goals, processes, information, along with the underlying
   application and technological infrastructure. Such models cross-cut
   different concerns and are often conceptualized using domain-specific
   modelling languages. This paper explores the application of graph-based
   semantic techniques to specify, integrate and analyse multiple,
   heterogeneous enterprise models. In particular, the proposal described
   in this paper (1) specifies enterprise models as ontological schemas,
   (2) uses transformation mapping functions to integrate the ontological
   schemas and (3) analyses the integrated schemas with graph querying and
   logical inference. The proposal is evaluated through a scenario that
   integrates three distinct enterprise modelling languages: the business
   model canvas, e3value, and the business layer of the ArchiMate language.
   The results show, on the one hand, that the graph-based approach is able
   to handle the specification, integration and analysis of enterprise
   models represented with different modelling languages and, on the other,
   that the integration challenge resides in defining appropriate mapping
   functions between the schemas.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - This study aims to construct mechanisms of big data-driven
   business model innovation from the market, strategic and economic
   perspectives and core logic of business model innovation.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors applied deductive reasoning
   and case analysis method on manufacturing firms in China to validate the
   mechanisms.
   Findings - The authors have developed an integrated framework to deduce
   the elements of big data-driven business model innovation. The framework
   comprises three elements: perspectives, business model processes and big
   data-driven business model innovations. As we apply the framework on to
   three Chinese companies, it is evident that the mechanisms of business
   model innovation based on big data is a progressive and dynamic process.
   Research limitations/implications - The case sample is relatively small,
   which is a typical trade-off in qualitative research.
   Practical implications - A robust infrastructure that seamlessly
   integrates internet of things, front-end customer systems and back-end
   production systems is pivotal for companies. The management has to
   ensure its organization structure, climate and human resources are well
   prepared for the transformation.
   Social implications - When provided with a convenient crowdsourcing
   platform to provide feedback and witness their suggestions being
   implemented, users are more likely to share insights about their use
   experience.
   Originality/value - Extant studies of big data and business model
   innovation remain disparate. By adding a new dimension of intellectual
   and economic resource to the resource-based view, this paper posits an
   important link between big data and business model innovation. In
   addition, this study has contributed to the theoretical lens of value by
   contextualizing the value components of a business model and providing
   an integrated framework.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to understand the beginning of
   value co-creation by uncovering the roles, efforts, and desired outcomes
   of employees and how they affect employees' responses to their firm's
   co-creation initiatives.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study applies a single case study to
   explore micro-level processes at the beginning of value co-creation
   informed by a case about how a Taiwanese firm moved from a conventional
   to a co-creative business model.
   Findings - The case study findings affirm nine subthemes that underlie
   three key themes: co-creation dynamics, efforts, and betterment. The
   authors provide a value co-creation framework that is informed by nine
   subthemes derived from interview data.
   Research limitations/implications - Current literature on understanding
   value co-creation processes focuses on formalized co-creation processes
   which produce diverse and contextually dependent findings. The authors
   contribute to current value co-creation literature by offering
   convergent insights into the interplay of dynamics, efforts, and
   betterment experienced by employees transitioning to a value co-creation
   process.
   Practical implications - The authors offer a diagnostic value
   co-creation checklist and propose three benefits of using the checklist,
   which can help managers mitigate the uncertainty that arises during the
   transition from a conventional to a co-creation firm.
   Originality/value - The study responds to calls for research to
   investigate where and when the co-creation of value emerges, value
   co-creation behavior from employees' point of view, and employees' roles
   in the co-creation of value.}},

Title = {{The implementation of integrating reporting < IR > in SMEs Insights from
   a pioneering experience in Italy}},
Journal = {{MEDITARI ACCOUNTANCY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{4, SI}},
Pages = {{505-532}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper aims to discuss the most critical aspects relative
   to the ``usability{''} of the International Integrated Reporting Council
   (IIRC) Framework faced by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in
   releasing the integrated report and adapting the Integrated Reporting
   (IR) principles (i.e. materiality, integrated thinking and connectivity)
   to their needs and features. Only recently the relevance of IR for SMEs
   has been internationally acknowledged.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on both a deductive and
   inductive approach. The first one is founded on a literature and
   technical review aimed at tracing the theoretical background and the
   framework on integrating reporting in SMEs. The second one is
   empirically constructed and follows the action research approach because
   it involves the analysis of a single case-study relative to a company -
   Costa Edutainment Spa that released its pioneering integrated report in
   2014 - belonging to the Italian Network on Business Reporting, a working
   group which has been involved in the pivotal drafting process of a
   Guidance for IR in SMEs.
   Findings - Results emphasise the main criticalities faced by an SME in
   the IR process, namely, the need for the following: clearly defining the
   relationship between sustainability and integrated reporting; adapting
   the main IR concepts (such us materiality, integrated thinking and
   connectivity) and fully understanding the benefits deriving from the
   implementation of IR. Moreover, results shed light on the usefulness of
   a simplified and operative guidance for releasing the integrated report
   within SMEs the effectiveness deriving from the direct involvement in
   the NIBR working group and the provision of practical examples and
   suggestions.
   Research limitations/implications - The main limitations are due to the
   fact that the empirical analysis is related to a single case study, and
   it is explorative in nature. Consequently, results are not
   generalisable. However, the work contributes to nourish the debate on
   the benefits and critical issues relative to the diffusion of IR among
   SMEs in a research field which has not been adequately investigated and
   to develop reflections on the benefits of the diffusion of the IR among
   SMEs, pointing out the opportunity to follow an evolutionary path which
   drives the evolution of the entrepreneurial and organisational culture
   towards monitoring, assessing and reporting the company's value process
   creation. Practical implications - The work contributes to triggering
   the debate on the diffusion of IR among SMEs which represents a research
   field that remains still under investigated. It points out a fundamental
   gap on how to implement IR in SMEs and operationalise the IIRC concepts
   and principles. It develops reflections on the critical issues and
   benefits of the diffusion of the IR among SMEs. Drawing from a
   pioneering experience, the work contributes to supporting entrepreneurs
   by emphasising the possible benefits deriving from the implementation of
   the IR process. It suggests an evolutionary path through different steps
   (starting from the business model definition) which are necessary to
   drive the entrepreneurial and organisational culture towards monitoring,
   assessing and reporting the SMEs' value process creation.
   Originality/value - The work contributes to devoting the attention of
   both scholars and practitioners to an underestimated research field -
   the ``feasibility of IR in the SMEs context - which has not been yet
   adequately investigated. Moreover, being empirically based, it helps in
   supporting the diffusion of the IR framework among SMEs, practitioners
   and consultants by providing insights aimed to improve the IR Guidance
   for SMEs and sensitise entrepreneurs by emphasising that a possible
   step-by-step ``IR journey{''} is possible.}},

   PROCESS OF DISTRIBUTION}},
Journal = {{LOGFORUM}},

Abstract = {{Background: Distribution, from the business point of view, is a set of
   decisions and actions that will provide the right products at the right
   time and place, in line with customer expectations. It is a process that
   generates significant cost, but also effectively implemented,
   significantly affects the positive perception of the company. Institute
   of Logistics and Warehousing (IliM), based on the research results
   related to the optimization of the distribution network and consulting
   projects for companies, indicates the high importance of the correct
   description of the physical location within the supply chains in order
   to make transport processes more effective. Individual companies work on
   their own geocoding of warehouse locations and location of their
   business partners (suppliers, customers), but the lack of
   standardization in this area causes delays related to delivery problems
   with reaching the right destination. Furthermore, the cooperating
   companies do not have a precise indication of the operating conditions
   of each location, e.g. Time windows of the plant, logistic units
   accepted at parties, supported transport etc. Lack of this information
   generates additional costs associated with re-operation and the costs of
   lost benefits for the lack of goods on time. The solution to this
   problem seems to be a wide-scale implementation of GS1 standard which is
   the Global Location Number (GLN), that, thanks to a broad base of
   information will assist the distribution processes.
   Material and methods: The results of survey conducted among Polish
   companies in the second half of 2016 indicate an unsatisfactory degree
   of implementation of the transport processes, resulting from incorrect
   or inaccurate description of the location, and thus, a significant
   number of errors in deliveries. Accordingly, authors studied literature
   and examined case studies indicating the possibility of using GLN
   standard to identify the physical location and to show the perspective
   of its implementation in the TSL industry.
   Results: Result of the work is an analysis of the current situation and
   problems associated with an identification of physical locations in the
   distribution process and the description of the information needs of the
   TSL industry. Shows strengths and weaknesses of the GLN standard and
   opportunities and threats arising from its implementation in logistics.
   In addition, authors developed a business model that main aspect is the
   value proposition and benefits for stakeholders in the processes of
   distribution.
   Conclusions: The ability to implement GS1 standards in logistics,
   despite numerous references to literature and the real needs of
   business, it is still ambiguously defined. Therefore, in this article
   authors focus on the concept of using GLN standard to improve an
   identification and unification of description of physical location. This
   study resulted in the development of tool implementing founded
   functionality (in the context of providing information about the
   physical location) in business practice.}},

Journal = {{EKONOMSKI VJESNIK}},

Abstract = {{Franchising has been present in the global economy in its current format
   for more than a hundred years. Companies have used franchising for
   growing their business and geographical expansion by bridging the
   distance in partnership with local entrepreneurs. Micro franchising
   provides a proven business model and a chance for self-employment by
   exploiting all advantages of franchising on a far smaller scale than
   traditional franchising. This model also helps potential entrepreneurs
   with low income to cross certain barriers, establish a sustainable
   business and create opportunities for new employment with the mentorship
   of the franchisor. With micro franchising, franchise systems could open
   locations where franchising in the traditional format would (could) not
   work and by doing so it could expand their business and gain
   competitiveness on the market, while at the same time enhancing
   employment and the development of entrepreneurship.
   This paper examines the micro-franchising situation in Croatia and
   checks if this model of growing business can help in increasing
   competitiveness of a company and at the same time enhance
   self-employment. Due to their pioneer work in the field of micro
   franchising in Croatia, Body Creator and Surf'n'Fries were chosen as
   practical examples.}},

Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},

Pages = {{2340-2358}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The food industry is a well-established and complex industry.
   New entrants attempting to penetrate it via the commercialization of a
   new technological innovation could face high uncertainty and
   constraints. The capability to innovate through collaboration and to
   identify suitable strategies and innovative business models (BMs) can be
   particularly important for bringing a technological innovation to this
   market. However, although the potential for these capabilities has been
   advocated, we still lack a complete understanding of how new ventures
   could support the technology commercialization process via the
   development of BMs. The paper aims to discuss these issues.
   Design/methodology/approach - To address this gap, this paper builds a
   conceptual framework that knits together the different bodies of extant
   literature (i.e. entrepreneurship, strategy and innovation) to analyze
   the BM innovation processes associated with the exploitation of emerging
   technologies; determines the suitability of the framework using data
   from the exploratory case study of IT IS 3D - a firm which has started
   to exploit 3D printing in the food industry; and improves the initial
   conceptual framework with the findings that emerged in the case study.
   Findings - From this analysis it emerged that: companies could use more
   than one BM at a time; hence, BM innovation processes could co-exist and
   be run in parallel; the facing of high uncertainty might lead firms to
   choose a closed and/or a familiar BM, while explorative strategies could
   be pursued with open BMs; significant changes in strategies during the
   technology commercialization process are not necessarily reflected in a
   radical change in the BM; and firms could deliberately adopt interim
   strategies and BMs as means to identify the more suitable ones to reach
   the market.
   Originality/value - This case study illustrates how firms could innovate
   the processes of their BMdevelopment to face the uncertainties linked
   with the entry into a mature and highly conservative industry (food).}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces and applies the concept of critical business model
   analysis to explore dysfunctional behaviour in the UK retail banking
   sector and to outline possible policy approaches. The paper starts from
   the conventional micro-economic framing of banking as the outcome of
   insufficiently competitive markets, yet after two decades of policy
   responses the sector is not only more concentrated but also homogeneous,
   dominated by financialized organisations focused on sustaining high
   rates of return on equity. Critical business model analysis is used to
   reframe the banking sector as one based on mimetic behaviours, including
   mis-selling of financial products and opaque charging. In doing so, the
   paper contributes to the public debate on the reform of retail banking
   by highlighting the potential, importance of a wider diversity of
   business models within the sector as a way of offering customers a
   different choice and limiting the scope of financialized practices. (C)

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this empirical study is to investigate
   extrinsic motivations that may affect adding or acknowledging
   user-generated content (UGC) on business websites, which are based on
   voluntary crowdsourcing.
   Design/methodology/approach - A conceptual model of extrinsic
   motivations for knowledge sharing in UGC-based websites was developed,
   suggesting reciprocity, awareness of rewards and prestige as main
   extrinsic motivations for adding content. The model was examined via an
   online survey of users of three websites that varied in the attributes
   of knowledge shared and reward type: The Traveler (tangible rewards),
   Stack Overflow (virtual rewards) and Waze (virtual rewards).
   Findings - Importance of extrinsic motivations varied among websites, as
   it may be affected by attributes of the knowledge shared. Reciprocity
   positively affected recommending the website, and adding content
   affected acknowledging content.
   Research limitations/implications - Investigating extrinsic motivations
   is important because websites may take actions that affect them. Further
   research is required to reveal the potential of voluntary crowdsourcing
   in business contexts addressing both intrinsic and extrinsic
   motivations, prosumption and open innovation.
   Practical implications - When reciprocity is a major aspect of a UGC
   website, badges and similar mechanisms may serve as a main extrinsic
   motivation to share knowledge.
   Originality/value - The novel empirically validated model provides
   theoretical and practical insights for designing mechanisms for
   increasing extrinsic motivation for knowledge sharing according to
   specific characteristics of UGC websites.}},
