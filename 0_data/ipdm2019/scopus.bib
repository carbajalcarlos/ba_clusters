abstract={The research presented in this paper looks at evaluating RAMI4.0, a Research Architecture (RA) designed for Industry 4.0, through the representation of an existing Cyber-Physical System's (CPSs) key functionality. The use case represented is that of a UK firm refurbishing End of Life (EoL) IT devices for business clients. EoL refurbishment is a domain with many complexities due to an inherent business model which results in varying quantities, types and conditions of received devices. These uncertainties can generally not be addressed until the devices have arrived in the facility and are inspected. RAs are an important tool used in system development to represent functionality, this representation should be high level and allow the easy communication of key concepts for not only client-to-developers and developer-to-developer but also either to an audience. An appropriate RA will help industrialists to understand what Industry 4.0 means to them (i.e. increased flexibility and control) and the functionality of any system potentially being invested in. The results of this research included two proposals for the extension of RAMI4.0 regarding the representation of security and humans within the systems. While Industry 4.0 focusses on CPSs this work also makes a further recommendation that the focus of modelling should be shifted to Cyber-Physical Human Systems (CPHSs) to ensure correct consideration of the humans within the system. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Servitization and Industry 4.0 are considered two of the most recent trends transforming industrial companies. Servitization is mainly focused on adding value to the customer (demand-pull) while Industry 4.0 is frequently related to adding value to manufacturing process (technology-push). Although some scholars address them as complementary concepts, the literature lacks evidences about what are the interfaces and connection between the two trends. Thus, we aim to develop a conceptual framework that connects Servitization and Industry 4.0 concepts from a business model innovation (BMI) perspective. Our framework is based on three Servitization levels (i.e. smoothing, adapting and substituting) and three levels of digitization (i.e. low, moderate and high levels). We show that matching these levels results in nine possible configurations classified in manual, digital and industry 4.0-related services, which can focus on smoothing, adapting or substituting services. We use reported cases from the literature to support and illustrate these configurations. We also discuss different levels of complexity for the implementation of these configurations. The study hence provides a foundation for the growing research on the interface between Servitization and Industry 4.0. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The digital transformation of manufacturing (a phenomenon also known as "Industry 4.0" or "Smart Manufacturing") is finding a growing interest both at practitioner and academic levels, but is still in its infancy and needs deeper investigation. Even though current and potential advantages of digital manufacturing are remarkable, in terms of improved efficiency, sustainability, customization, and flexibility, only a limited number of companies has already developed ad hoc strategies necessary to achieve a superior performance. Through a systematic review, this study aims at assessing the current state of the art of the academic literature regarding the paradigm shift occurring in the manufacturing settings, in order to provide definitions as well as point out recurring patterns and gaps to be addressed by future research. For the literature search, the most representative keywords, strict criteria, and classification schemes based on authoritative reference studies were used. The final sample of 156 primary publications was analyzed through a systematic coding process to identify theoretical and methodological approaches, together with other significant elements. This analysis allowed a mapping of the literature based on clusters of critical themes to synthesize the developments of different research streams and provide the most representative picture of its current state. Research areas, insights, and gaps resulting from this analysis contributed to create a schematic research agenda, which clearly indicates the space for future evolutions of the state of knowledge in this field. © 2019 by the authors.

abstract={Due to the combination of vast technology trends brought by Industry 4.0, present-day consumers need and stiff global competition and require businesses from across many industries to constantly innovate. Clients request multifaceted support from manufacturers and service providers while the transition towards new symbiotic ecosystems disrupts traditionally established processes in some sectors. This is largely happening in the global automotive industry where in-car and around-the-car services with asset-sharing concepts are taking a dominant role rather than plain vehicles sales and car ownership. In our paper, we investigate the possibilities of new and improved business collaborations between a car retailer operating in several European countries and its SME (small and medium-sized enterprises) customers across various sectors currently owning car fleets of at least five vehicles. We test several hypotheses and conduct a systematic statistical analysis of the proposed business model's aspects on the sample of almost 200 SMEs from five countries in Southeast Europe. By using the Χ 2 test and a one-tailed t-test we tested both frequency data and the continuous variables. Research indicates that SMEs look for new ways to organize their fleet management strategy more efficiently and thus more precisely plan associated costs. Regardless of the country of origin, SMEs want to explore a business model with more introduced to their fleet management and are ready to accept new technologies for fleet management operations. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={The concept of "Industry 4.0" is expected to bring a multitude of benefits for industrial value creation. However, the associated risks hamper its implementation and lack a comprehensive overview. In response, the paper proposes a framework of risks in the context of Industry 4.0 that is related to the Triple Bottom Line of sustainability. The framework is developed from a literature review, as well as from 14 in-depth expert interviews. With respect to economic risks, the risks that are associated with high or false investments are outlined, as well as the threatened business models and increased competition from new market entrants. From an ecological perspective, the increased waste and energy consumption, as well as possible ecological risks related to the concept "lot size one", are described. From a social perspective, the job losses, risks associated with organizational transformation, and employee requalification, as well as internal resistance, are among the aspects that are considered. Additionally, risks can be associated with technical risks, e.g., technical integration, information technology (IT)-related risks such as data security, and legal and political risks, such as for instance unsolved legal clarity in terms of data possession. Conclusively, the paper discusses the framework with the extant literature, proposes managerial and theoretical implications, and suggests avenues for future research. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Purpose: Starting from the foundations of value innovation, this paper aims to give an idea of the key drivers and barriers – internal and external to the company – and to provide insight into proven capabilities underscoring the ability to create a flow of new value initiatives. These thoughts are then confronted with the present challenges of Industry 4.0 and the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). The confrontation leads to the identification of five capabilities for future-proof value innovation. Design/methodology/approach: Literature review based upon the work of the author with more than two decades of experience within value innovation research is included. The review is supplemented with recent literature and an overview of the challenges of Industry 4.0/IIoT, which leads into a confrontation of the present status of value innovation with future requirements. Findings: Value innovation remains important specifically for established companies facing path-breaking digital disruption of their existing business models provoked by Industry 4.0 and IIoT. Five key capabilities are suggested to rejuvenate value innovation and prepare it for the Industry 4.0 challenge: capabilities for designing, adapting and marketing product service systems; capabilities for blending digital strategy and processes with value offerings; capabilities for designing and mobilizing ecosystems and integrating these into a value-based IIoT platform; capabilities for combining and integrating technological and value innovation approaches; and capabilities for linking value creation to value capturing. Research limitations/implications: This paper is more of a “viewpoint” than an empirically based paper presenting new research findings. It is based on expert judgment and confrontation with extant literature. The outlook indicating five key capabilities needs further empirical corroboration. Practical implications: The overview of barriers and the “toolkit” for value innovation (Figure 1) and the five capabilities for future value innovation are expected to be managerially relevant. Originality/value: The paper highlights the concept of value innovation, as discussed over the past decades, and links it to recent challenges and opportunities imposed by Industry 4.0 and the IIoT. The concept of value or strategic innovation is still valid but needs a re-conceptualization in view of these developments. The paper provides five capabilities business marketers should develop to perform value innovation in an Industry 4.0 environment. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The Fourth Industrial Revolution is centered around a self-organized production. Cyber-physical systems can be used to collect and share data for tracking, automation and control as well as evaluation and documentation. This has a wide-reaching impact on business models. Instead of a linear approach, concentrating on a single company, the focus needs to be on the complete production ecosystem represented by a dynamic and self-organized network, including the supply chain. The interconnectedness of the cyber-physical systems in these networks is rooted in the Internet of Things, but also shared business processes. Performance, stability, security as well as data integrity and access control hereby represent a major contributing factor, calling for a new concept of information processing systems. The blockchain is a distributed ledger combining cryptographic and game-theoretic concepts, which enable immutable transactions and automatic consensus of the parties involved about its state. Blockchains have evolved as a fast-developing technology, promising increased efficiency and security in many scenarios, especially use cases that primarily rely on all kinds of transactions. The paper follows a design science approach, examining the implications of blockchain and the industrial Internet of Things in Industry 4.0 (I40) on supply chain management. I40’s implications on supply chains are discussed and connected with favorable characteristics of blockchain technology. Based on this analysis, requirements for a decentralized enterprise information processing system are derived, resulting in a reference model for distributed supply chains of I40. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

abstract={The so-called fourth industrial revolution features the application of modern Information & Communication Technology (ICT) concepts and technologies in industrial contexts to create more flexible and innovative products and services leading to new business models and added value. The emerging Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is one of the main results of this revolution. One of the most known and adopted communication protocol in the context of the fourth industrial revolution is OPC UA (IEC 62541). Although this standard already combines features coming from both industrial and ICT contexts, current literature presents several approaches aimed to introduce ICT enhancements into OPC UA in order to further improve its usability in industrial environments. Some of these approaches are based on the proposal to make OPC UA RESTful, due to many advantages of RESTful services in industrial settings. OPC UA is based on a client/server architecture and adopts an information model at the server side, whose access from the client side requires knowledge of a data model, whose structure is sometimes complex, creating some difficulties for a resource-constrained device acting as client. The paper proposes the definition of a web platform able to offer access to OPC UA servers through a REST architecture. The approach presented in the paper differs from other existing solutions, mainly because it allows to realise a lightweight OPC UA RESTful interface reducing the complexity of the basic knowledge to be held by a generic user of the platform. For this reason, the solution presented allows enhancement of OPC UA interoperability towards resource-constrained devices. The web platform has been implemented and the relevant code is available on GitHub. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The industrial world is undergoing many changes and often all these modifications are referred to as “industry 4.0”, a term introduced in Germany in 2011. There are many doubts about what is going to change within and without a company, in particular as regards the Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) concept, and its use in this new industrial framework. Starting from the main concepts of industry 4.0 in this paper the meaning of CPS inside the framework of industry 4.0 is analyzed by defining its main features and comparing it to the business model of the fourth industrial revolution, which is based on a service oriented architecture, SOA, with the aim of a flexible, modular and customized production process. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019},

abstract={Purpose: Industry 4.0 is expected to significantly transform industrial value creation. However, research on business models affected through Industry 4.0, and on small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), remains scarce. In response, the purpose of this paper is to address both aspects, further elaborating on the role that SMEs can take toward Industry 4.0 as provider or user. Design/methodology/approach: The paper used an exploratory research design based on 43 in-depth expert interviews within the three most important German industry sectors, mechanical and plant engineering, electrical engineering and automotive suppliers. Interviews were conducted with leading personnel of the respective enterprises, including 22 CEOs. They assign business model implications through Industry 4.0, referring to the Business Model Canvas, while the paper delineates between Industry 4.0 providers and users. Findings: The paper finds that key resources and value proposition are among the most affected elements of the business model, whereas channels are the least affected. Furthermore, distinct characteristics between Industry 4.0 providers and users can be delineated. In general, Industry 4.0 providers’ business models are significantly more affected than users, except for key partners and customer relationships. Research limitations/implications: Industry 4.0 remains at its early stages of implementation. As a result, many interviewees’ answers remain at a rather general level. Practical implications: Strategies for the further alignment of the business models are provided for Industry 4.0 providers and users. Originality/value: The paper is among the few that investigate Industry 4.0 in the context of SMEs and business models. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

A new aspect that will be fully developed in Industry 4.0 processes is to use new business models that will work on platforms within a collaborative economy. As a result of Industry 4.0 we can expect an increase in efficiency and productivity of the Slovak economy with unknown effects on the labor market and the income of the population.

abstract={Industry 4.0 leads to the digitalization era. Everything is digital; business models, environments, production systems, machines, operators, products and services. It's all interconnected inside the digital scene with the corresponding virtual representation. The physical flows will be mapped on digital platforms in a continuous manner. On a higher level of automation, many systems and software are enabling factory communications with the latest trends of information and communication technologies leading to the state-of-the-art factory, not only inside but also outside factory, achieving all elements of the value chain on a real-time engagement. Everything is smart. This disruptive impact on manufacturing companies will allow the smart manufacturing ecosystem paradigm. Industry 4.0 is the turning point to the end of the conventional centralized applications. The Industry 4.0 environment is scanned on this paper, describing the so-called enabling technologies and systems over the manufacturing environment. © 2019 Karabuk University},

abstract={Industry 4.0 (I4.0) is changing business models and processes. I4.0 uses innovative trends such as Big Data, Cloud Computing, and Internet of things (IOT) to maximize economic benefits and return on investments. However, developing an I4.0 project may be costly, complex and risky for some companies. Therefore, careful requirements definition and mature Requirement Engineering (RE) processes are necessary. Undeveloped RE processes and poorly defined business requirements will often result in an inferior or a cancelled project. In addition, to ensure agility and allow for iterative changes in developing projects for I4.0, agile methodologies should be applied and prudently assessed. Unfortunately, most of existing assessment models are narrow focused and lack theoretical foundation and proper validation. This research proposes a comprehensive maturity framework called agile Requirement Engineering Maturity Model for Industry 4.0 (ARE-MMI4.0). The framework provides assessment of the minimum maturity levels to start a project for I4.0. The framework integrates an I4.0 maturity model with RE and agile maturity models to ensure the ultimate maturity assessment for the business processes. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The Industry 4.0 Italian plan is the new attempt of the National Government in Italy to adopt a comprehensive industrial policy aimed to adapt the industrial sector to the new trajectories of manufacturing. A variety of policy plans and interventions have been recently developed in order to sustain these processes everywhere in Europe. The 9 enabling technologies identified in the so called ‘Calenda plan’ (from the Italian ministry of economic development name, coordinated the plan writing) are not just a list of industrial technologies available, but are a chance for (re)create a new business model in the factory 4.0, but more and more in the ‘social environment’ 4.0 where the whole value chain in a business company need to be re-thought. An analysis of the potential impact of these policy frameworks has still to be implemented. This paper aims to disentangle the relationship between policies and the Italian manufacturing starting from an overview of the industrial policies in Italy and raising the main problems and contradictions potentially stemming out from the Italian plan. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Driven by technological progress, the fourth revolution industry, called generic "digitization" or Industry 4.0, emerged as a necessity streamlining the increasingly complex production processes, to be able to meet global consumption needs. The Industrial Revolution 4.0 is characterized by convergence of the greatest technological advances, such as robotics, artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, virtual and augmented reality, printing multidimensional, transforming production processes and business models. Leading companies are no longer focusing on the trends specific to their own sector of activity, but they are connected to potential transformations and disturbances that can affect suppliers, customers and related markets. In Industry 4.0, competitive advantage is built in close collaboration with partners through a management effective change and an effective adaptation capacity the organization chart at the posts of the future as well as by investing in the new technologies. Romania is in a favourable position to adopt the change (internet speed, IT sector development, newest technology already in the facilities big production), but the leap towards digitization depends on flexibility and ability to quickly understand that the public and private sector is manifesting itself in relation to these profound transformations. The future of companies that will remain in the same paradigm of the traditional economic model is uncertain. The research aims to identify the most popular technologies on the market; as well as the attributes for an efficient digital adoption. The increase of digital adoption on Romania market is a reaction to favorable business environment and technologies availability.

abstract={The paper outlines key characteristics of smart manufacturing, data-driven, networked, connected, resource sharing, resilient, and sustainable. Manufacturing resiliency and sustainability have received limited attention in the literature and they are the focus of this paper. Both are related and offer challenges that may become differentiators of smart manufacturing. Resiliency provides businesses with defenses against natural and human caused adversities. The list of attributes provided in the paper is intended for comprehensive assessment of manufacturing resiliency. Solutions are needed to make businesses more resilient and sustainable. Research on business models equating sustainability with an industrial activity is suggested. A scheme for labeling environmental friendliness of materials makes as a token contribution to sustainability. © 2019},

abstract={Implementation of the Industry 4.0 concept leads to in-depth end-to-end automation of all activities of an integrated power grid and requires fundamentally new technologies that change conventional business models. Operational assets of power grid companies are characterized by semantic, syntactical, structural and systematic heterogeneity, which hinders the interaction at all management levels aimed at accident prevention and performance improvement. A cognitive double-level ontological model was developed as an aggregate of the conceptual confinement model and a set of hierarchic confinement models of processes of technical condition diagnostics, repair program development and optimization, as well as optimization of logistic processes as the repair program is being implemented in a power grid company. A structural process scheme of distribution zone repair management in Q-scheme symbolism, generalized and detailed modeling algorithm schemes were developed. An interaction graph for components of the power grid repair management process was developed. Elementary components of the stochastic process of interaction of the repair management process elements were detailed by their sets of states. The sub-model “Consumption of consumable materials and resources”, realized in the Arena simulation package, was detailed. Examples were provided regarding the application of intelligent techniques at the strategical and operational levels of power grid management for structural synthesis of a balance scorecard system and identification of apparent defects of process equipment. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

abstract={A study of the management of the information infrastructure of a digital enterprise is conducted within the framework of the "Industry 4.0" concept. It is determined that modern digital technologies cause an exponential growth of data flows, for the effective functioning of which the need arises to transform a classic enterprise into digital. There are new business models, network structures based on collective methods of production and consumption, which transform traditional market relations and require the development of new solutions in the field of digital enterprise management. It is noted that the use of all elements (mobility; sociality; BPM, electronic document management system ERP finance and accounting; Big Data Analytics, business analytics) of modern information and communication technologies will increase the productivity and value of enterprises. It is determined that information and communication technologies allow to effectively interact with each other in certain sectors of production and ensure the optimization of any business processes using consumerization. Modern trends in the development of digital enterprises are identified and the prerequisites for the introduction of digitalization in the business space are marked. The constituent elements of the management process of the information infrastructure of a digital enterprise are structured, on the basis of which a model of the information infrastructure management process is proposed. The objectives of the digital infrastructure are substantiated, which are indicated: to increase the speed of decision-making, to increase the variability of processes depending on the needs and characteristics of the client, to reduce the number of employees involved in the process. The methodological foundations of the process of managing the information infrastructure of a digital enterprise are deepened in the context of the "Industry 4.0" concept. © 2019 Kateryna Andriushchenko, Volodymyr Rudyk, Olena Riabchenko, Maryana Kachynska, Nataliia Marynenko, Lidiya Shergina, Vita Kovtun, Mariia Tepliuk, Alla Zhemba, Oksana Kuchai.
Проведено дослідження процесу управ- ління інформаційною інфраструктурою цифрового підприємства в межах концепції «Індустрія 4.0». Визначено, що сучасні циф- рові технології викликають експоненціаль- не зростання потоків даних, для ефектив- ного функціонування яких постає питання трансформації класичного підприємства в цифрове. З'являються нові моделі веден- ня бізнесу, мережеві структури, що ґрун- туються на колективних методах вироб- ництва і споживання, трансформують традиційні ринкові відносини і вимагають вироблення нових рішень в галузі управлін- ня цифровим підприємством. Зазначено, що використання всіх елементів (мобільність; соціальність; BPM; система електронного документообігу; ERP фінанси та облік; Big Data & Analytics, бізнес-аналітика) сучас- них інформаційно-комунікаційних тех- нологій дозволить підвищити продуктив- ність та цінність підприємств. Визначено, що інформаційно-комунікаційні технології дозволяють ефективно взаємодіяти між собою в певних галузях виробництва та забезпечують оптимізацію будь-яких біз- нес-процесів за допомогою консьюмеріза- ції. Ідентифіковано сучасні тренди розвит- ку цифрового підприємства та окреслено передумови до впровадження цифровізації у бізнес-простір. Структуровано складові елементи процесу управління інформацій- ною інфраструктурою цифрового підпри- ємства, на базі чого запропоновано модель процесу управління інформаційною інфра- структурою. Обґрунтовано цілі цифрової інфраструктури, які зазначені: в підвищен- ні швидкості прийняття рішень, збільшен- ні варіативності процесів в залежності від потреб та особливостей клієнта, зниженні кількості залучених до процесу співробіт- ників. Поглиблено методичні основи проце- су управління інформаційною інфраструк- турою цифрового підприємства в умовах концепції «Індустрія 4.0».},

abstract={Industry 4.0 is the conceptual era where Internet and digital technology becomes an enabler for innovation and transformation. Digital transformations are required by Telecommunication firms to transform their portfolio beyond the pipeline to close the gap in business model innovations, redefine customer engagement and co-creation, and set up new distinctive organization capabilities. This paper has the objective to develop a digital transformation model by assessing the mediating role of co-creation strategy on the relationship between distinctive organizational capability and business model innovation. The units of analysis are Indonesian telecommunication firms, using a sample of 35 out of 445 telecommunication firms. The analytical approach used for analysis is Smart Partial Least Square (PLS). The study results reveal that distinctive organizational capability has an indirect effect on business model innovation, but direct effect to co-creation strategy. © 2018, Czestochowa University of Technology.

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyze the current state of fabrication laboratories (Fab Lab), an international network of digital laboratories, which provides new technological tools for digital manufacturing that can be used from individual users, to small businesses and schools. The aim is to understand similarities and differences of skills, technologies used and customers served among the main European laboratories (Italy, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain) and the American ones. Design/methodology/approach: Data from European and American Fab Labs were collected using a questionnaire survey performed on a total sample of n=493 Fab Labs. The administration of the survey took place through e-mail; 73 Fab Labs participated to the survey, reaching a total response rate of 14.81 percent. Findings: The results show that Italian laboratories are characterized by ample space available, but limited capacity for investment in machinery and technology. European Fab Labs are similar to the Italian Fab Labs, while the American ones are more heterogeneous in size. However, a fact that emerges clearly from the results is how American Fab Labs are more important realities than European ones in terms of turnover and investments. They are more similar to businesses with an independent financial support. Originality/value: The novelty of the study resides in the issue considered and the experimental techniques used. Some qualitative case studies have been developed in the field, but no previous quantitative analyses have been developed on a large sample of Fab Labs, developing comparisons between European and American realities of these digital laboratories. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Sustainable development and the circular economy are two important issues for the future and the competitiveness of businesses. The programs for the integration of sustainability into industrial activities include the reconfiguration of production processes with a view to reducing their impact on the natural system, the development of new eco-sustainable products and the redesign of the business model. This paradigm shift requires the participation and commitment of different stakeholder groups and industry can completely redesign supply chains, aiming at resource efficiency and circularity. Developments in key ICT technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), help this systemic transition. This paper explores the phases of the transition from a linear to a circular economy and proposes a procedure for introducing the principles of sustainability (environmental, economic and social) in a manufacturing environment, through the design of a new Circular Business Model (CBM). The new procedure has been tested and validated in an Italian company producing ceramic tiles, using the digitalization of the production processes of the Industry 4.0 environment, to implement the impact assessment tools (LCA-Life Cycle Assessment, LCC-Life Cycle Costing and S-LCA-Social Life Cycle Assessment) and the business intelligence systems to provide appropriate sustainability performance indicators essential for the definition of the new CBM. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={The article investigates the role of business model innovation by Industry 4.0 solution providers and their impact on process innovation of their customers. Industry 4.0 solution providers are hereby seen as the enablers and providers of Industry 4.0 technologies, which provide access to several potentials of Industry 4.0 technologies to their customers. In particular, the role of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that provide solutions that are based on Industry 4.0 technologies for their customers are investigated, which in turn can improve and innovate their own processes. Frist, the article presents an overview of the current state of research and a brief theoretical background. Second, the article bases its findings on an empirical study of 111 Industry 4.0 providers from Germany that are SMEs. Analyzing the results of questionnaires, correlations between Industry 4.0 solutions and two perspectives are examined: benefits for the solution providers and benefits for process improvements and innovations of the customers. Subsequently, the article discusses these findings, closing the article with both managerial and research implications. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={Technology has become ubiquitous, it is all around us and is becoming part of us. Together with the rise of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) paradigm and enabling technologies (e.g., Augmented Reality (AR), Cyber-Physical Systems, Artificial Intelligence (AI), blockchain or edge computing), smart wearables and IoT-based garments can potentially have a lot of influence by harmonizing functionality and the delight created by fashion. Thus, smart clothes look for a balance among fashion, engineering, interaction, user experience, cybersecurity, design and science to reinvent technologies that can anticipate needs and desires. Nowadays, the rapid convergence of textile and electronics is enabling the seamless and massive integration of sensors into textiles and the development of conductive yarn. The potential of smart fabrics, which can communicate with smartphones to process biometric information such as heart rate, temperature, breathing, stress, movement, acceleration, or even hormone levels, promises a new era for retail. This article reviews the main requirements for developing smart IoT-enabled garments and shows smart clothing potential impact on business models in the medium-term. Specifically, a global IoT architecture is proposed, the main types and components of smart IoT wearables and garments are presented, their main requirements are analyzed and some of the most recent smart clothing applications are studied. In this way, this article reviews the past and present of smart garments in order to provide guidelines for the future developers of a network where garments will be connected like other IoT objects: the Internet-of-Smart-Clothing. © 2018 by the authors.

abstract={The considerable body of literature on business models, business model innovation, and sustainable business models has yet to fully account for the impact of external dynamics- including the digital imperative-on generating sustainable value propositions. To address this issue, we developed amultifaceted framework of transformative sustainable businessmodels, spanning three levels: the external environment, the organization, and the individual. We drew on the resource-based view and the literature on digitization to explain how organizations can capitalize on dynamic transformative capabilities to generate novel value propositions, based on both reconstructionist logic and shared-value logic. These include elements such as co-creation, usage-based pricing, agility, closed-loop processes, asset sharing, and collaborative business ecosystems. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={Industry 4.0 is characterized by intensive digitization of production and equipping the machines with a high use of ICT (information and communication technology. However, the fourth industrial revolution brings with it more security-related challenges. It is important to engineer, industrial solutions that design, build and run Industry 4.0-systems securely, reliably and effectively. Moreover, industrial systems are designed according to the new characteristics enabling connecting and interacting with other Industry 4.0-systems in a reliable manner. Furthermore, it is essential to consider the new innovative business models by designing these systems. The digital data and knowhow in companies are the most valuable assets and thus should be protected. This data are the new trade ware by many businesses and add new values to companies. In this paper, one of these models that are based on online-trading of technology data, is considered. Technology data are defined as machine's functioning parameters that are required to ensure a smooth operation of machines under different circumstances. The focus is to develop an Industry 4.0-capable machine with the new characteristics that an Industry 4.0-system have. The security concepts for protecting the technology data by designing and manufacturing the machine will be validated by means of a use case of participating in a technology data marketplace. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={This work makes a case for the integration of the increasingly popular and largely separate topics of Industry 4.0 and the circular economy (CE). The paper extends the state-of-the-art literature by proposing a pioneering roadmap to enhance the application of CE principles in organisations by means of Industry 4.0 approaches. Advanced and digital manufacturing technologies are able to unlock the circularity of resources within supply chains; however, the connection between CE and Industry 4.0 has not so far been explored. This article therefore contributes to the literature by unveiling how different Industry 4.0 technologies could underpin CE strategies, and to organisations by addressing those technologies as a basis for sustainable operations management decision-making. The main results of this work are: (a) a discussion on the mutually beneficial relationship between Industry 4.0 and the CE; (b) an in-depth understanding of the potential contributions of smart production technologies to the ReSOLVE model of CE business models; (c) a research agenda for future studies on the integration between Industry 4.0 and CE principles based on the most relevant management theories. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={This paper is addresses the question, whether the steel industry will be able to generate substantial, additional business volume with digital business models (like Apple or Google) or whether it is just chasing a ghost. Criteria for successful innovation in the steel industry in the 20th century, as well as in the digital 21st century, are analyzed and compared. The author concludes that digitalization will form the 6th Kondratieff cycle, but that, regarding digitalization and Industry 4.0, the steel industry differs substantially from other industries (e.g. automotive). According to the author, it will be decisive and critical whether the steel industry will be able to attract a sufficient number of Industry 4.0 engineers in the future. © Verlag Stahleisen GmbH.

abstract={Continuing digitalization on the way to industry 4.0 opens up a number of new opportunities for pulp and paper manufacturers and converters. Options range from process optimization to the establishment of new value creation networks and business models. Even skeptical entrepreneurs will have to face these facts if they want to remain competitive. Paper industry managers find themselves confronted with the problem of finding optimal solution concepts that will sustainably ensure business success. However, significant expenditure and the need for a high level of resources constitute a major stumbling block for many companies on their path to the fourth industrial transition. BTG Process Solutions experts specialize in the implementation of solution concepts that give high initial benefits at low resource requirements, thus providing a solid basis for an efficient approach to Industry 4.0. This is illustrated by a number of examples from industrial practice including the optimization of a pulp bleach plant, the implementation of a prediction model on a paperboard machine and the Vigilance 4.0 concept applied to the operation of a Yankee cylinder for tissue manufacture. © 2018 Deutscher Fachverlag GmbH.

abstract={With the concept of Industry 4.0 spreading, smart manufacturing is going to work in a brand new production process, in which a number of technologies are integrated, including cyber-physical systems, the Internet of Things, and the Internet of Services, to facilitate a new business model of 'smart manufacturing and service'. The key to an intelligent automation system is the capability of software/hardware system integration regarding various equipments and controllers, where response time of the equipment plays an important role. However, in an industrial transmission network, the hardware specification of the receiver is probably not good enough, so that the processor in the receiver may be unable to process multiple requests simultaneously. This paper proposes a method for scheduling multiple periodic requests. This method can reduce the burden on the device when the device is high loading in order to maintain the effective operation of the device. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={The emerging Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) will not only leverage new and potentially disruptive business models but will also change the way software applications will be analyzed and designed. Agility is a need in a systematic service engineering as well as a co-design of requirements and architectural artefacts. Functional and non-functional requirements of IT users (in smart manufacturing mostly from the disciplines of mechanical engineering and electrical engineering) need to be mapped to the capabilities and interaction patterns of emerging IIoT service platforms, not to forget the corresponding information models. The capabilities of such platforms are usually described, structured, and formalized by software architects and software engineers. However, their technical descriptions are far away from the thinking and the thematic terms of end-users. This complicates the transition from requirements analysis to system design, and hence the re-use of existing and the design of future platform capabilities. Current software engineering methodologies do not systematically cover these interlinked and two-sided aspects. The article describes in a comprehensive manner how to close this gap with the help of a service-oriented analysis and design methodology entitled SERVUS (also mentioned in ISO 19119 Annex D) and a corresponding Web-based Platform Engineering Information System (PEIS). © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technology developments in Cloud Manufacturing (CMfg) are challenging traditional business models, and adapting these is key to a sustainable competitive advantage. In parallel, pay-per-use strategies are being discussed as an enabler to future sustainable societies. The general benefits of CMfg services are clear, but to date the actual business implications from a service provider perspective have not been discussed. This article explores new business model opportunities based on the idea of providing CMfg as a completely new type of Product-Service Systems. Technology developments and business recommendations are defined, considering the proposed business model targets the manufacturing industry as a whole. Manufacturers make use of their spare capacity by purchasing time on networked equipment on a pay-per-use basis. This allows costs to be brought down, whilst creating new revenue streams. It also increases machine hosts’ competitiveness by reducing investment costs and enabling instant manufacturing scalability. CMfg is then classified into three levels of machine autonomy, arguing that as technology develops intermediaries may slowly integrate vertically and eventually replace manufacturers by completely autonomous equipment. The proposed business model presents both a first step and a baseline point of reference towards bridging the gap between advanced manufacturing technology and new business development in the context of I4.0 (Smart Manufacturing). © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={The idea of Collaborative Manufacturing, also known as the Production Networks or Social Manufacturing, has been around for more than 25 years. It is a production concept based on non-hierarchical collaboration among enterprises often referred as Virtual Enterprise (VE). Despite many scientific research and projects with this topic, it is difficult to find an example of fully operational non-hierarchical production network anywhere in the world. However, that fact could be changed very soon. Namely, the new industrial revolution, called Industry 4.0, encourages industrial enterprises to adopt information-communication technology (ICT) and Internet of Things (IoT) into their production systems, thus creating Cyber-Physical Production System (CPPS). From the aspect of production networks, CPPS represents crucial infrastructure, or a missing link between enterprises. Now, with CPPS in place, non-hierarchical networking and collaboration becomes possible through Smart Collaborative Production Networks. In this research, the concept of information system for Smart Collaborative Production Networks was developed and called ‘VENTIS’. Although the idea of the concept is to manage the collaboration inside Virtual Enterprise, in this research, a special focus has been put on manufacturing planning phase in which optimization problem known as the Partner Selection Problem (PSP) occurs. Since the PSP in manufacturing phase is far more complex than partner selection during the collaborative product development phase, new research premises regarding the Virtual Enterprise type have been set. Two types of Virtual Enterprise business models – Push-type and Pull-type – have been defined in this research. If VE is Push-type, HUMANT algorithm is used to solve PSP that occurs in that case. If VE is Pull-type, a special procedure, inspired by phenomenological reduction, has been established in which set of a priori created VEs is compared with theoretically ‘the best’ VE and theoretically ‘the worst’ VE. Enterprises’ data of production network from Dalmatia (Split-Dalmatia County, Croatia) is used as a Case Study to present ‘VENTIS’ concept and to present the procedure for creation of sustainable Virtual Enterprise. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The concept of Industry 4.0 consists of the digital technologies introduction in companies. It is the way to call the phenomenon of digital transformation applied to the production industry. The problem faced by organizations is that they assimilate the global idea of Industry 4.0 and the technical aspects associated with it. Industry 4.0 is highly linked to technologies such as the Internet of things, which favors predictive analysis, based on the information collected through these solutions, making it easier for companies to anticipate consumer requests. It is necessary that companies can readjust and plan their operations quickly and accurately to respond to the new demands of consumers. The products proliferation will continue to increase in the coming years, in a context that will allow greater customization. Therefore, companies must take advantage of market analysis to improve their supply chains and meet the demands of their users, since the customization of products requires a clear connection with production capabilities. The objective of the research is to describe the properties of Industry 4.0, to propose a measurement system according to the principles of the supply chain, by means of the descriptive and comparative research method. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

abstract={This chapter aims to contribute to evaluate market options for business models to be adopted by industrial agents. To achieve this object, a methodological approach for a critical observation was pursued. First, it was conducted a theoretical review, regarding the business model (BM) concept and related definitions, as its relationship with strategy, tactical, and operational level of a generic company, innovation, innovation management, structure, and components, among others. Then an analysis of experiences of practical business model adoption by economy actors, typical industrial arrangements or those related to industrial actions, productive chains or practices, were studied, to produce an overlook of its classical, traditional and influential aspects. Finally, in this analysis, reflections around these findings are presented, contributing for BM practice for industrial organizations and associated value-aggregation partners, as from service sectors, which, nowadays, even pressure industries to adopt or adapt to their business models. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

abstract={The advances of cloud computing and Internet-of-things (IoT) technologies are motivating the transformation from the traditional product-focused development to service-oriented business models with cloud-based solutions in many companies. Different business approaches have emerged with innovative ideas on creating intelligent services and profitable business ecosystems with many actors involved in various value chains. In this transition process, the design of business models plays an essential role to a company's growth and success, and requires a mindset shift in how to create and capture value for companies in the connected world. In order to adapt to the global and collaborative business environment, some of the traditional business models are further developed to adjust to the Internet-of-things context, and some new ones have emerged. The aim of this study is therefore to survey these business modeling and design methods, identify their characteristics, and analyze how they manage the dynamic, global, and collaborative environment in the Internet-of-things business ecosystem. We discuss also the challenges related to the business model transformation process for businesses, including data, services, transition process, and legal and regulation perspectives. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={The term additive manufacturing (AM) groups together a set of technologies with similar characteristics forming part of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. AM is being developed globally, as evidenced by the standards published by and the agreements between the ISO and the ASTM in 2013. The purpose of this paper is to anticipate the main changes that will occur in AM by 2030 as forecast by more than 100 Spanish experts through Delphi prospection performed in 2018. In this way, the areas, aspects, and business models with the greatest probabilities of occurrence are obtained. The need for technical experts with specific knowledge and skills requires changes to current training syllabuses. Such changes will enable students to have the profiles foreseen in these job trends. The encouragement of STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) training through the introduction of AM in study plans may be an appropriate alternative. Finally, the consequences of the Fourth Industrial Revolution for the employment market and on jobs, particularly in Spain, are set out and the latest Spanish Research, Development, and Innovation (R & D + I) plans are summarized as the framework for the possible implementation and development of AM. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={Industry 4.0 is a polarizing subject, affecting industries transnationally since 2011. To determine the state of Industry 4.0 across French companies in 2018, a pilot study was carried out dealing with six Industry 4.0 dimensions: Product Development Process, Steering Control, Manufacturing Operations, Smart Services, Big Data, and Organization Structure. Specialist knowledge and implementation of advanced technology in all dimensions is prerequisite to achieve a high standard in Industry 4.0. Beyond that, the interconnection and the integration of all elements along the value chain is crucial. Combined with the existing literature on these dimensions, the researchers assess and describe the current state and the existing challenges. The focus of the survey was to get insights in the activities of French companies towards Industry 4.0, and thereby assessing their state in each dimension. Good approaches were considered, but there is a lack of knowledge about the extensive aspects and the significance of Industry 4.0. Especially in cases, where Industry 4.0 technologies enable new business models such as Big Data or Smart Services, the knowledge is limited. Best known and partially implemented are elements in Product Development and Production. However, there is a lack of understanding for the key aspect across all interviewed companies; the integration of various objects in the value chain. The six dimensions cannot be treated separately, neither in theory nor in practice. It has become abundantly clear that there is room for improvement, and that Industry 4.0 is a highly relevant topic the companies need to confront in-depth and in detail. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Digitization of business processes is changing the industry. Enterprises using data as efficiently and smart as possible, can often create a clear competitive advantage and be more responsive to their customer needs. Through the smart use of data, new business models can be created. The most well-known changes of digitization are taking place in the B2C market. The B2B market is affected by this change too. Enterprises recognize the ongoing shift to a service-oriented society and therefore should be able to react directly to the customer needs. Service based business models, such as implementing Smart Services, are developed and intergarted in existing enterprise offerings. This paper reports upon a study of the maturity level regarding Smart Services of three selected German enterprises. The aim is to highlight the the impact of the ongoing digital transformation and map the maturity levels with regards to digitization and Smart Services. The case studies offer a first assessment about the current situation of Smart Services, using sub-categories to pinpoint developments, in manufacturing enterprises. The analysis shows that the maturity levels of these enterprises depend on their technology management, financial resources and corporate culture. The three cases have a high maturity level and already implemented Smart Services in their business model strategy. Nevertheless, there is still potential for improvement, especially regarding 'Simultaneous Engineering' and 'Automation Level'. It can be stated that within these enterprises financial resources, critical awareness as well as know-how of digitization and Smart Services are available. The cases were organizationally rather set in rigid structures. In order to reach an even higher degree of maturity and thus to remain competitive in the future, the enterprises should fundamentally rethink their corporate culture. These case studies may be considered as a pilot study into this topic, with refinements and improvements to further studies possible. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Ongoing technological development pushes industry towards the so called fourth industrial revolution. Considering new technology as a determinant of future business environment, we find it necessary to examine how platforms such as Industry 4.0 will change enterprises organization and business models. Designed model should serve as guidance for new and also already existing enterprises for implementing of Industry 4.0 required attributes especially in early stage. Main emphasis is given on software and cloud solutions that will become necessary despite the fact that in recent industrial SMEs they do not play significant role. Such transformation will raise crucial questions about funding new technologies. © 2018 Leos Safar et al.},

abstract={The advent of the Fourth Industry Revolution calls for companies to radically rethink existing business models and innovate business models through detailed and consistent strategies. In this study, three types of business model frameworks are presented as methods to cope with the Fourth Industrial Revolution at the enterprise level. We also have designed business model frameworks that utilizes four axes; hyper-connectivity, hyper-intelligence, hyper-convergence, and hyper-predictability. And then, we finally suggest a framework of smart connected business model. This model uses information and communication technology to create an online and offline platform, enhances the connectivity of human beings, objects and markets, and analyzes and utilizes the data generated here. It is a circulation structure that develops existing products (or services), market, and business models, which create prediction, customization, and innovation. © 2018, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

abstract={Purpose: While digitisation is a key driver of the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0); organisations have different approaches to deal with this topic to get a clearer picture of the opportunities and challenges concerning the digital transformation. The purpose of this paper is to identify the impact of digitisation on procurement and its role within the area of supply chain management. The research will also explore potential barriers to digitising procurement and supply chains and ways to overcome them. Finally, the significance of potential enabling technologies to the digitisation will also be examined. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative approached utilising an online survey was used to collect the primary data for this study. Data were collected from 414 participants directly involved with procurement or related business functions and work for different organisations in different industries. The survey included eight items about the impact of digitisation on organisational performance in the area of procurement and supply chains; ten items related to key barriers to digitisation of organisations and ways to overcome them; and seven items about enabling technologies to leverage procurement procedures and processes digitisation. All of these items utilised the Likert five-point level of agreement scale. Findings: The findings indicate that digitisation of procurement process can yield several benefits including: supporting daily business and administrative tasks, supporting complex decision-making processes, procurement will become more focussed on strategic decisions and activities, procurement will become a strategic interface to support organisational efficiency, effectiveness, and profitability, and supporting the creation of new business models, products, and services. The authors were also able to confirm that there are barriers to digitising procurement process and supply chains and such barriers found in existing procedures, processes, capacities, and capabilities. Finally, the significance of a number of enabling technologies to the digitisation process was revealed. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study of its kind with participants located world-wide. Industry 4.0 as a topic had been explored within different business areas and functions but very limited research specifically explored potential impact, barriers, and enabling technologies of procurement 4.0. The results can be beneficial for organisations already implemented Industry 4.0 or planning to do so. The study can also benefit academic scholars interested in the researched topic, business professionals, organisations within different sectors, and any other party interested in understanding more the concept of procurement 4.0. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Globally, Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has fundamentally changed how products are designed, manufactured, shipped and sold to consumer. This has compelled the manufacturing industry constantly to evaluate their product and service to stay ahead of their peers. It requires a completely new approach for designing products as well as manufacturing systems that support to achieve high productivity. With IoT, IP networks and analytics, manufacturers can become more efficient in operation, improve safety environment and offer new business models. IoT connects all devices and takes instant decision. Manufacturers adopt this new dynamic change will have a variety of new opportunities for revenue growth and cost savings. This article aims to construct IoT frame work for manufacturing industries by integrating ERP applications with operation devices to reduce the material wastage, production cost and improve quality, efficiency and margin. © IAEME Publication.},

abstract={The objectives of this paper are (1) to have a detailed, practical discussion of Industry 4.0, and (2) to suggest policy implications to transition toward Industry 4.0 in Korea. Companies should consider Industry 4.0 very seriously as they develop their future initiatives since traditional manufacturing business models do not fit with the emerging technologies of Industry 4.0. Some issues should be addressed with care: IT security, reliability and stability needed for critical machine-to-machine communication; a need to maintain the integrity of production processes, avoid IT snags, and protect industrial knowhow; and the lack of adequate skill-sets, general reluctance to change by stakeholders, and loss of many jobs to automatic processes and IT-controlled processes. To successfully transform Korean industry toward Industry 4.0, it is necessary to (1) refine and elaborate the strategies enacted by the central government to build economic and social systems that can flexibly respond to changes, (2) establish some kind of operational system to maximize the effectiveness of initiatives and policies, (3) develop concrete and workable action plans to transition toward economic and social systems that can accommodate innovative changes, and (4) establish infrastructure to lead all initiatives. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The article analyzes how Industry 4.0 triggers changes in the business models of manufacturing SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises), by conducting a qualitative research with a sample of 68 German SMEs from three industries (automotive suppliers, mechanical and plant engineering, as well as electrical engineering and ICT). As SMEs play an essential role in industrial value creation, the article examines significant, yet at present understudied implications of Industry 4.0 along industrial value chains. First, the results show that Industry 4.0 encompasses three dimensions, namely high-grade digitization of processes, smart manufacturing, and inter-company connectivity. Second, the article shows how Industry 4.0 affects the three business model elements of manufacturing SMEs – value creation, value capture, and value offer – by giving specific examples for business model innovation in each of the three elements. Third, it shows that both the role as a user and/or provider of Industry 4.0 and whether a company is internally motivated and/or externally pressured towards implementation have an impact on which business model elements are innovated. Fourth, the study delineates four SME categories, designed to help managers to evaluate their own company's positioning towards Industry 4.0: craft manufacturers, preliminary stage planners, Industry 4.0 users, and full-scale adopters. Article classification: multiple case study. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The increasing intelligence of products and systems, their intra-company cross-linking and their cross-company integration into value creation networks is referred to as Industry 4.0. Academics and practitioners, largely agreeing on the global importance of this proclaimed industrial revolution, have published many contributions on the topic. Research, however, is rather focused on investigating single technologies in quite specific application domains and largely neglects the profound managerial challenges underlying Industry 4.0. Given the recent plea for a more active contribution from the management science community, we strive to establish Industry 4.0 as a challenging but promising field for management research, and aim to assist scholars in engaging with the topic. Therefore, we first gather and analyze extant contributions by means of a systematic literature review and synthesize the information gained into 18 managerial challenges of Industry 4.0 falling into six interrelated clusters: (1) strategy and analysis, (2) planning and implementation, (3) cooperation and networks, (4) business models, (5) human resources and (6) change and leadership. Considering that Industry 4.0 is still an emerging topic and publications may therefore not always be found in highly ranked journals, we aimed to increase the confidence in our findings and triangulated our data by conducting an online survey of industry experts and academics that allows us to qualify the identified challenges in terms of importance and future research need. On this basis, we present an empirically backed research agenda and suggest fruitful avenues for future research in three basic categories: practice-enhancing research, knowledge-enhancing research, and high-impact research. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The traditional manufacturing business model is changing for new emerging models. Many changes are related to the industry 4.0 challenge and among them there is a concern regarding how industries will meet the objectives of sustainable operations, especially on that of environmental protection and process safety. Some industries are making great efforts to get aligned with the industry 4.0 paradigm, and for the Electric System Industry, it is no different. Because of its strategic and environmental importance, the electric system industry must be investigated. In this article we used qualitative research based on a systemic approach, using the Soft System Methodology (SSM) to address the challenges brought by the industry 4.0 paradigm in the electric system industry in Brazil, focusing on the topic of environmental protection and process safety. Moreover, we point out important capabilities needed by these companies to keep up with the new industrial revolution. Results from the SSM have exposed important management gaps and hence have shown new possible management models that can contribute to the modernization of the electric utilities in Brazil, making these industries more sustainable. In fact, it is imperative for companies to detail the organizational capabilities they will need to thrive in the business process. Therefore, we conclude the paper by indicating the three main dynamic capabilities that have emerged: new policies to enable innovation, bureaucracy reduction, and investments in education. © 2018},

abstract={The transport system is an important sector in economies, both in terms of its own share of gross national product and in its role as a presupplier, prime location and facilitator of private and occupational mobility. Like other industries, the transport system is subject to changes in technological trends, especially with regards to digitalisation. When analysing the forms and effects of digitalisation, one may be overwhelmed by the multitude of terms, such as: Industry 4.0, Physical Internet, Internet of Things, Radical Innovation, New Business Models and Digital Transformation. These terms are often interpreted in different ways because they have been specifically designed for agenda setting and thus for the enforcement of the individual interests of consultants, researchers and industries. And while transport has high hopes for digitalisation, it doesn’t necessarily apply to all parameters of the transport system. There are several relevant issues to consider including the extent to which digitalisation affects the traffic supply and demand and whether this will lead to an increase or decrease in traffic movements. © 2018, Springer Verlag.

abstract={Early warning systems are becoming increasingly important in high-risk industries, because of their potential to detect all kinds of subtle threats and opportunities, that is, weak signals, in order to avoid strategic surprises. However, it is an under-researched area within the context of smart factories. For the purpose of the study, semi-structured group interviews were used to investigate how managers at a smart factory, a highly innovative global supplier in the automotive industry sense weak signals, perceive the role of intuition, smart systems and business model adjustments. The results of the study show that managers perceive early warning systems as highly important for timely response to development changes and that both smart systems and intuition play an essential role in detecting and responding to weak signals. Based on this study, we propose a managerial early warning system model with four stages, namely, identifying, screening, appraising and responding to weak signs, within the context of a smart factory. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={In this paper, the author analyses the significant influence of IT on global megatrends. Of the five leading global megatrends, two are in the field of ICT, digital media and new technologies. The main reasons for the impact of IT megatrends are twofold: (1) the digital convergence of the media, ICT and telecommunications industries, (2)the exponential increase in information, computing power and internet transfer data. Digital convergence will significantly contribute to changing business models. In an applicative sense, the author considers the concepts of Industry 4.0 - The Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR), to be the most significant as it marks the paradigmatic change of information, the conceptual and processual transformation of data and services ecosystems in the domains of robotics, the Internet of Things (IoT), Internet of Services, Automated Intelligence, Collaborative Robots (Cobots), Industrial Robots, Augmented Reality, and Virtual Reality. In business and strategic terms, digital media business models will transition, under the influence of digital convergence, to a multiplatform, complementary, interoperable and networked media and ICT ecosystem with a specific focus on the production and distribution of media products, services and applications within the user interface, hypermedia, immersion, mass customization, personalized, augmented and ambient media business space and environment. © 2018 Croatian Communicologysts Association.

abstract={The evolution of markets and customer requirements with highest level of precision, has been achieved created with technology and information systems, a new way of make the operations in the companies, and just the companies with the ability to adapt faster to technological innovations may remain on the market. The last industrial revolution, known as industry 4.0 perceives the operations as a holistic system, its represents a challenge that must be fulfilled and faced in order to achieve stability and permanence in the market, from the point of view of the world economies. In the organizational and business area all the operations must be linked to computer systems and management of information in the network, which causes greater efficiency in the flow. With this new perception of industry and the business, it involves different analytical tools that aim at bigger efficiency in the service to the consumers, resulting in a greater competitiveness in the market and making the differentiator. This work is one of the first surveys that provides an extensive analysis and review of 110 publications that appear from 1/01/12 to 20/02/17. The purpose of the study is to analyze categorically recent advances through qualitative and segmentation methods allowing to reveal trends and areas of opportunity in the industry sense of 4.0 in order to obtain research gaps that may be executed in organizational systems on the value chain. Another point is to be a reference in future research related to the categories selected in this study. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.},

abstract={Manufacturing has evolved over the course of centuries from the days of handmade goods to the adoption of water- and steam-powered machines, the invention of mass production, the introduction of electronic automation, and now beyond. Today, the benchmark for companies to keep up with, is Industry 4.0. Here, Manufacturing systems go beyond simple connection, to also communicate, analyse and use collected information to drive further intelligent actions. It represents an integration of IoT, analytics, additive manufacturing, robotics, artificial intelligence, advanced materials, and augmented reality. The paper looks at the evolution of the Industrial revolution and the technologies that have impacted their growth. The proposed features of 5G technologies are listed and described how these features impact the Industries of the future, leading to Industries 4.0. 5G promises to be a key enabler for Factories of the Future, providing unified communication platform needed to disrupt with new business models and to overcome the shortcomings of current communication technologies. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Industry 4.0 will be the most powerful driver of innovation over the next few decades, innovation being the move towards sustainable competitiveness and profitable growth [1]. The research underpins the earlier research in methodological terms and traces successful performance such as productivity and quality results of an SME (small and medium-sized enterprise) within the context of Industry 4.0. This new industrial paradigm is not just about technology, but it also involves changes in the technical and production development, so current ways of value creation are evolving and bringing extensive organizational consequences and opportunities. Our case study presents the systematic diversification process described in the Maturity Model to implement Industry 4.0 scenario [2] in an automotive production company, using the three elements: Envision, Enable and Enact. We choose to present this case study because many companies want to start the implementation of this new business model. However, there is a gap of information concerning the steps that a small and medium production unit needs to make in order to change the strategy of the company regarding the Industry 4.0. All the above affect directly the productivity results without negative effects on the quality results of the analysed company. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={The fourth industrial revolution requires higher capabilities of changeability and reconfigurability (C–R) of the future factories (FoF), as well as a higher focus on business models that are based on total-cost-of-ownership (TCO) paradigm. Up to date, there are little scientific contributions to deploy C–R into TCO models, as well as to systematic plan and design manufacturing resources such as to facilitate FoF ecosystem. In order to address this issue, this paper introduces research results that show how to deploy C–R, connectivity, smartness and TCO requirements into the technical solutions of manufacturing resources of FoF. Contributions emerging from this research include an index to measure C–R capability of manufacturing resources, a model to assess economic feasibility of a FoF over its lifecycle, as well as a methodology and related tools to design smart connected manufacturing resources with embedded features to facilitate changeability and reconfigurability in a FoF. Theoretical contributions are explained through a case study of a fast reconfigurable robotic manufacturing cell. Preliminary results demonstrate that it is possible to rapid design smart connected manufacturing resources and integrate them into FoF architectures that support convertibility, integrability, modifiability, adaptability, serviceability, scalability, integration of resources from various producers, service clustering and cloud-based services. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={With the advent of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and cyber-physical systems, the multi-disciplinary area of mechatronics has become pervasive in “smart industry.” The infusion of the cloud IoT model to the business processes has broaden the horizon for the grocery business. This study puts forward an innovative design of a retail business model and its implementation, using sensor-based measurement containers (SBMCs) and an Android application, which contributes new ideas for the international community. SBMCs containers are employed in the system to mitigate the pressure related to a cloud IOT-enabled grocery management system (CE-GMS) for the management of necessary household commodities, by sensing their quantities on hand using an ultrasonic sensor. It allows an alert to be generated when the item quantities reach the reorder point. The proposed CE-GMS consists of four automated entities: production units, warehouses, stores and customer sites – all of which are equipped with SBMCs of varying physical capacities. Cloud computing aids the systems to communicate with each other for better coordination. The automated information flow from a customer's SBMCs is handled by the nearest store. The data in the store's containers are received by the warehouses, and the data in the warehouse's SBMCs is sent to the production units. This communication among entities occurs with the support of GPS and GSM modules. The entity which receives information has the responsibility for supplying the necessary commodity products, by sensing the demand of the entity regarding commodity depletion. Further, the articles discusses the locking mechanism in SBMCs, inventory monitoring and container tracking for interaction in CE-GMS to validate the grocery market's operations using an IoT-compliant layer. © 2018},

In order to avoid the uneven distribution of service requirements among service providers (i.e., non-equalization phenomenon), a lot of service strategies with different characteristics can be taken as candidate solutions to adjust the matching between service providers and service consumers. Based on the background, how to identify the application conditions of various service strategies in complex environment has become a serious challenge in the field. To solve this problem, the computational experiment-based evaluation method is proposed in this paper, including customization of service strategy, construction of experiment system, and experiment analysis of service strategy. In this paper, three possible service strategies are built to deal with the non-equalization phenomenon, i.e., non-equalization strategy, equalization strategy, collaborative equalization strategy. Experiment results show that: collaborative equalization strategy can effectively enhance the service utilization rate and reduce the completion time in short supply environment; equalization strategy is the optimal one in oversupply market environment. This case study can show that the proposed method is feasible and the result is satisfactory. © 2008-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Recent studies advocate that digital technologies are key enabling factors for the introduction of servitized business models. At the same time, these technologies support the implementation of the circular economy (CE) paradigm into businesses. Despite this general agreement, the literature still overlooks how digital technologies enable such a CE transition. To fill the gap, this paper develops a conceptual framework, based on the literature and a case study of a company implementing a usage-focused servitized business model in the household appliance industry. This study focuses on the Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data, and analytics, and identifies eight specific functionalities enabled by such technologies (improving product design, attracting target customers, monitoring and tracking product activity, providing technical support, providing preventive and predictive maintenance, optimizing the product usage, upgrading the product, enhancing renovation and end-of-life activities). By investigating how these functionalities affect three CE value drivers (increasing resource efficiency, extending lifespan, and closing the loop), the conceptual framework developed in this paper advances knowledge about the role of digital technologies as an enabler of the CE within usage-focused business models. Finally, this study shows how digital technologies help overcome the drawback of usage-focused business models for the adoption of CE pointed out by previous literature. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={In recent years and in the current industrial and societal scenario, technologies have been increasingly playing a key role in enabling new product and service offerings. Cyber-physical systems, Additive Manufacturing, Augmented Reality and Cloud Computing are some of the innovative solutions that will shape - or rather are already shaping - new business models and value propositions. Due to that, the industrial application of such technologies is currently under the lens of researchers, practitioners and policymakers. This paper addresses the employment of cutting-edge technologies for Product-Service Systems (PSS) through the definition of a comprehensive classification framework embracing both business and technology-related dimensions taken from literature.

abstract={Industry 4.0 provides new paradigms for the industrial management of SMEs. Supported by a growing number of new technologies, this concept appears more flexible and less expensive than traditional enterprise information systems such as ERP and MES. However, SMEs find themselves ill-equipped to face these new possibilities regarding their production planning and control functions. This paper presents a literature review of existing applied research covering different Industry 4.0 issues with regard to SMEs. Papers are classified according to a new framework which allows identification of the targeted performance objectives, the required managerial capacities and the selected group of technologies for each selected case. Our results show that SMEs do not exploit all the resources for implementing Industry 4.0 and often limit themselves to the adoption of Cloud Computing and the Internet of Things. Likewise, SMEs seem to have adopted Industry 4.0 concepts only for monitoring industrial processes and there is still absence of real applications in the field of production planning. Finally, our literature review shows that reported Industry 4.0 projects in SMEs remained cost-driven initiatives and there in still no evidence of real business model transformation at this time. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Having the capability to process live streaming data is now the fundamental requisite for the successful realization of Industrial Internet of Things (IoT) and poses huge benefits in terms of increased operational efficiency, lesser costs and diminished risk to the industrial world. The advent of IoT and big data analytics technology offers further opportunities in manufacturing business models and asset management. For industrial manufacturing processes that are typically fast-paced and ridden with sophisticated set of conditions, such on-the-fly, real-time, fine-tuning adjustment suggestions of a predictive nature are challenging to describe. However, when provided properly, streaming analytics is greatly useful in the pursuit of improved industrial performance. We developed a streaming analytics system that used to evaluate stable manufacturing efficiency of multiple production lines simultaneously. This paper illustrates an use case from semiconductor manufacturing industry in Taiwan to present the data-driven applicability of streaming analytics system that enables companies to collect a large number of real-time, heterogeneous plant data with steps of text extraction, causal correlation, statistical modeling, as well as real-time monitoring and anomaly detection, to improve overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) of industrial manufacturing. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={In a nonownership business model (NOBM), a company maintains product ownership and sells only product performance to its customers. While NOBMs are not an entirely new phenomenon, the digital technologies-such as the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)-that facilitate the use of such BMs are relatively new. An increasing number of manufacturing companies are looking into offering nonownership services. However, prior research highlights that, so far, manufacturers have had mixed experiences with servitization strategies including IIoT-based services. Therefore, there is an important theoretical and practical impetus for research on how manufacturers can benefit from NOBMs, and how new technologies help manage the uncertainties associated with such BMs. Drawing on a multiple-case study with three globally operating manufacturers, our study examines the uncertainty upsides and downsides resulting from the adoption of NOBMs, as well as the role of IIoT capabilities in unlocking and mitigating these upsides and downsides, respectively. Preliminary study findings are presented, followed by a discussion of contributions and opportunities for future research. © International Conference on Information Systems 2018, ICIS 2018.All rights reserved.},

abstract={There is a growing interest in the pay-per-outcome business models in manufacturing industries because of novel technologies provided by Industry 4.0 implementations. These business models for the software companies cannot be directly applied for manufacturing companies because of the scalability issues as well as complexity issues. The purpose of this paper is to identify perceived benefits and risks of Industry 4.0 enabled pay-per-outcome models for manufacturing companies (machine builders). We conducted qualitative interviews of machine building companies. We identified and selected companies that have been experimenting with novel Industry 4.0 enabled pay-per-outcome business models. We were able to create understanding the perceived benefits and risks of these advanced industry 4.0 enabled PPU/PPO type business models for machine builders. Since there is a limited amount of practical implications especially in case of investment heavy machine builders thus there is little understanding about related benefits and risks of implementing these novel Industry 4.0 enabled pay-per-outcome business models. This study can facilitate decision making of managers about implementing these novel business models by taking into account the expected benefits as well as bottlenecks encountered. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2018.},

abstract={The internet-of-things (IoT) can change not only products but also companies’ whole business model. The goal of this article is to inform companies about the creation of business intelligence via utilisation of the industrial IoT. This review article assumes that combining business excellence, service design and knowledge gathering via data engineering into cognitive infocommunication (CogInfoCom) opens new possibilities to develop business ideas. These new possibilities are examined through a literature review on deployments of industrial IoT solutions. The survey responds to two research questions: what methods of knowledge gathering and business excellence are used in industrial IoT-based product, service and process innovations? How can knowledge gathering, business excellence and CogInfoCom methods be utilised to create added value in industrial IoT solutions? This survey reveals the richness and delicacy of these exploitation opportunities. Copyright © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={The global competition requires the machine tool industry to provide more flexibility and productivity to its manufacturing customers, enabled through software-intensive services. A platform approach receives an increasing attention within the machine tool industry, offering a solution to provide such services. Software platforms, adapted to the needs of the industry and used in the industrial application are also known as industrial internet of things (iIoT) platforms. Despite the growing interest among manufacturing companies in iIoT platforms, they have been limitedly researched from the economic perspective. Consequently, a further in-depth analysis of platform-based business models in the area of iIoT is still needed. Firstly, this paper offers new insights on technical and economical criteria for business models and design of existing iIoT platforms and transforms them into a taxonomy. These merged criteria provide a detailed perspective on iIoT platforms and support machine tool companies in their decision process of suitable iIoT platforms. The criteria are based on the results of 17 qualitative interviews with companies from the machine tool industry. Secondly, the identified criteria are summed up in a morphological box, in order to reduce the selection complexity of an iIoT platform by the machine tool companies and sharpen the software-intensive business models of the platform providers. © 2018 CEUR-WS.

abstract={Driving aspects in the developments of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) are based on markets demanding a highly flexible production on the one hand and, on the other hand, by the production industry looking for new business models. This is enabled by interconnecting intelligent devices and aggregating and analyzing huge amounts of data. In the section of field devices, targeted new developments are dealing with intelligent systems which support users in each stage of the product life cycle. During installation and commissioning of a new machine, the concept of Plug-and-Produce has been created in the production industry. It is relating to the analogy of Plug-and-Play in the field of information technology which makes it possible to recognize and use devices without additional effort across several platforms. Industrial production systems differ in some aspects from Plug-and-Play computer devices that these methods are not applicable without adjustments and more advanced considerations. Solutions to support the commissioning process are scope of this contribution and analyzed theoretically by the example of the integration of an electro-hydraulic actuator. Two results are highlighted in this contribution. Different IIoT related concepts and technologies (i.e. OPC-UA, Cyberphysical systems, semantics) are presented and merged to realize Plug-and-Produce as an holistic business process. Furthermore, the draft combines the domain of fluid power with the abstract and generalized concepts and models and gives an understanding of future requirements for fluid power field devices in the context of IIoT.

abstract={Industry 4.0 (I4.0) also known as the fourth industrial revolution has emerged for describing the digitalization of manufacturing industries. In practice, the transition to I4.0 is crucial for manufacturing firms to sustain competitive advantage and seize new opportunities. Most research focuses on the technological aspects of I4.0 in form of product and process innovations. Despite I4.0's rising attention among both researchers and practitioners, there exists only little research about I4.0 business model innovation (BMI), even though business model (BM) innovators can be more successful than product or process innovators. To address this research gap, we analyze 15 case studies of I4.0 BM innovators. We develop a taxonomy to characterize I4.0 BMs and derive 13 archetypes of I4.0 BMIs that describe transitions towards I4.0 BMs. The three identified super-archetypes are integration, servitization and expertise as a service. Our study deepens the understanding and structure of I4.0 BMs and I4.0 BMIs. © 2018 Association for Information Systems. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The so-called fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) is changing the landscape in the manufacturing industry. Although recognized as an essential factor to preserve competitiveness, organizations are still figuring out drivers, enablers and barriers as well as suitable business models to pave the way for innovations in fields such as highly customized products or exponential technologies. The central challenge for a successful adoption of Industry 4.0 is not primarily the required technology, but the emergence and aggregation of a common view and sound models focusing on paramount aspects like quality, customer perception and margins. We argue that available solutions for modeling business strategies fail at providing sufficient guidance for organizations in analyzing opportunities and driving innovations due to their narrow nature as well as missing combination and aggregation possibilities. In contrast, we outline a multi-perspective framework to support organizations in analyzing their context at multiple levels and discuss technological requirements as well as challenges for the development of modeling tools that support hierarchical integration of analyses and models as well as different perspectives to converge on an organization-wide aligned business strategy. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.},

abstract={The concept of Industry 4.0 is a new reality of the modern economy, because innovation and technological development play an important role in each organization. Industry 4.0 significantly changes products and production systems concerning the design, processes, operations and services. Certainly, the implementation of this concept has further consequences for management and future jobs through creating new business models. The objective of the present paper is to present the attitude of entrepreneurs to Industry 4.0, to indicate readiness for implementing the elements of the concept and to point out the barriers, which may possibly threaten enterprises in the effective achievement of a higher technological and organizational level. The research conducted in the paper is based on secondary data, obtained from many professional reports and studies, carried out by State institutions, consortia or enterprises. The international analyses coming from those documents show a significant interest in challenges imposed on companies by the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The majority of the respondents recognize the concept of Industry 4.0 as a great opportunity for development and improvement in competitiveness, although the state of preparations for its implementation varies widely depending on country, sector, or even an individual company. © 2018, Czestochowa University of Technology.

abstract={The article proves that the industrial policy is not only an element coordinating the various types of state policies. It is as well a platform, on which the economic policy of the state is built. I systematize five directions representing the traditional approach to understanding the industrial policy and three new directions of its understanding. I emphasize that a new purpose of the industrial policy as the achievement of «an image» of a “good economy”, and that the «standard projects» of regional industrial policy are unacceptable. I define new characteristics of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Its fundamental features are harmonization and integration of a large amount of research disciplines. This, in turn, imposes high requirements to developing priorities for both the federal and regional industrial policy. Another feature of the Fourth Industrial Revolution is the emergence of the digital economy. I analyse its development in Russia as compared with the developed countries. Moreover, I systemize the studies about the readiness of Russian companies for the digital economy. The information and communication technologies are the most important factor for the digital economy. The analysis of these technologies development in regions showed high level of its differentiation of regional indicators (from 1.5 to more than 300 times). The assessment of the development of information and communication technologies allow categorise the Middle Urals as a leading region almost for all indicators in this area not only in the Ural Federal District, but also in Russia, in general. The importance of new business models as most essential innovations during the Fourth Industrial Revolution has increased. This defines new agents and objects of industrial policy. The results of the research may be used to correct the regional strategy of socio-economic development as well as laws on industrial policy. © 2018 Institute of Economics, Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

Based on the results, a set of features, issues and requirements have been identified and three different approaches has been suggested to make firms getting closer to the industry 4.0 phenomenon such as service orientation, networked ecosystems and customer orientation. Furthermore, the impacts on the creation, delivery, and capture of value through the reconfiguration of Business Models due to embracing the Industry 4.0 are depicted. As a result, four different ways to innovate the business models based on different degrees of innovation are proposed to embrace the digitalization. Those paths goes from optimizing internal and external processes or improving customer relationship to creating new value networks or smart products and services through disruptive business models. © 2018 The Authors.

abstract={In today's turbulently expanding business environment, during the fourth industrial revolution, it is necessary to respond to market trends and to adapt strategy and organisational structure appropriately. The article is focused on the reorganisation and optimisation of the business organisation structure of global companies. The purpose of this paper is to analyse and evaluate the use of the territorial business structure, within the framework of a global company, based on experimental research. Experiences with the introduction of a territorial organisational structure in a corporate enterprise have proven to be highly effective long-term, with productivity and sales volumes increasing. This territorial setting can be considered as a competitive advantage, which matches predicted market trends and is suitable for global businesses. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={In a continuously changing business environment and the era of digitalization, business models need to adapt constantly to allow organizations to differentiate themselves from their competitors and to secure their economic survival. However, organizations are neither able to review their business model management nor systemize it productively. Hence, the combination of Industry 4.0, business model and business model management aspects emphasizes an organization's potential and results in an increased competitive and operational success. To guide an organization's advancement, a maturity model for business model management is developed, which delivers assistance suitable to an organization's requirements and strategic orientation. It assesses the organization's current maturity level and proposes sequential steps to advance towards a refined business model and process mastery by indicating improvement potentials. Thus, the maturity model links an organization's existing organizational and operational knowledge to new concepts and makes it accessible through a modified business model for Industry 4.0. © 2018 Leuphana Universitat Luneburg.

abstract={Oil and gas producers are challenged with addressing long-term business needs such as: improving health, safety, and environment; extending life of production equipment; increasing reliability to reduce maintenance cost; reducing losses; improving operability to reduce personnel cost; improving productivity; increasing production; and improving governance and regulatory compliance. To meet these business needs, operating companies are once again investing, now in digital transformation of how their sites are run and maintained. Personnel are digitally enabled. For safety this includes digital distress calls, digital safety checks for situational awareness, digital mustering and geolocating. For reliability, new ways of working include digital inspection and predictive maintenance of more of the equipment, digital collaboration with experts, digital documents on-the-go, and digital integrity management. For operations, new best practices include digital operator rounds including on EOR injection wells and digital logbooks. Also, instead of having people at site; some personnel instead work from a city office or equipment monitoring is outsourced to a service provider as Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)-based connected services. This digital transformation is made possible with new technologies such as wireless sensor networks, analytics software, and cloud computing making condition monitoring for a broader scope of process equipment practical, and enable new business models without capital outlay. Wireless, non-intrusive sensors along with readymade software apps enable easy and rapid deployment of these solutions at low cost. Digital transformation with IIoT and advanced software does not require costly and time-consuming custom programming, but can be accomplished through purpose-built, readymade apps with embedded subject matter expert knowledge. Using platform-agnostic apps, operating companies can use their existing middleware instead of replacing it, and without adding another expensive platform layer, thus protecting existing investment. Results from digital transformation include: extended life of production equipment to ensure continued service of facilities and operations, maintenance cost reduction, operations cost reduction, improved productivity, and increased production. Further, all departments benefit from the same digital infrastructure, which also enhances integration across disciplines. © 2018, Offshore Technology Conference.},

abstract={Technology will change the way people perform work and impact the operating model of organisations. Bhalla, Dyrcks and Strack (2017) states: “a tidal way of change is coming that will soon make the way we work almost unrecognizable to today’s business leaders. In an age of rapidly evolving technologies, business models, demographics, and even workplace attitudes – all shifting concurrently – change is not only constant but also exponential in its pace and scope.” These changes result from the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) and its emphasis on technological innovation and digital productivity in organisations. Traditionally, all managerial and operational areas in organisations have been enabled and supported by knowledge management (KM) in the form of a codification or personalisation strategy. However, in the 4IR organisation it is acknowledged that “knowledge” will be in the form of “big data” which is received by sensors and transmitted to actuators and can be analysed in a cloud-based cyber-physical system. This requires re-conceptualisation on the relevance of knowledge management in supporting the functional areas of organisations as well as the manner in which knowledge management manifests. More importantly on the applicability and relevancy of knowledge management in an age where humans are seamlessly connected through ubiquitous technologies. What will the role of knowledge management be in organisations and societies where humans will become redundant because of the ability of machines to perform both repetitive but also highly complex work? It is evident that the manifestation of knowledge management will change radically in 4IR organisations. Change is imminent and knowledge management needs to evolve or subside into a cyber-physical realm. Hence, a literature review and three case studies reflect on the interrelationship between technology and knowledge management within the context of the 4IR organisation. © 2018 Academic Conferences Limited.},

abstract={The socio-economic trends in the last decades (population growth, rapid industrialization and urbanization) have accelerated the transition from the old linear material flow to the more sustainable circular economy (CE). CE is recognized as a clear value creation opportunity, which can bring the lasting benefits of a more innovative, resilient and productive economy. Nevertheless, there is a huge gap between the big concept of CE and the practical actions. In particular, the research and the implementation of circular models to date have mainly focused on the product end-of-life, in order to reduce, reuse and recycle waste, but the lack of feedback information and performance indexes does not allow the measurement of how a product, a process or a company is really transiting from linear to circular models. This critical issue limits the further development of other circular activities. The impending digital transformation within the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution’ can support CE to provide these missing aspects. Starting from the consolidated CE model, the paper describes how the application of intelligent assets, Internet-of-Things and big data, could be the basis to create a more promising circular model, where CE principles are extended to the entire product life-cycle, from product design to product utilization, considering also production assets and business strategies. Some case studies, described in literature, are presented to demonstrate how smart assets can interact with circular economy to create a new and more productive model of CE, characterized by a complete and effective circular platform for materials, products, assets and processes, where information and indicators are collected to measure circular efficiency. © 2018 AIDI - Italian Association of Industrial Operations Professors.

abstract={We are currently on the marks of Industry 4.0. Characterized by increased digitalization and automation, it is expected to overturn traditional business models and supply chains. Industry 4.0 initiatives have already made significant impact on industry, and will continue to do so in the years to come. While the concept of Industry 4.0 gains a foothold, there is no clear idea of how it should be addressed by companies. The transformation is without a doubt a strategic imperative that requires long-term commitment. Instead of investing in new technologies in an ad hoc manner, companies need to adopt a systematic approach to address technological opportunities throughout the supply chain. There exist many different and, in some cases, conflicting opinions about the scope of such an approach, what it should contain, its point of departure, etc. This paper synthesizes such views into a framework that depicts the strategic landscape manufacturing companies are facing at the outset of their digital journey. The framework can be used to position and discuss companies’ digitalization and automation initiatives with respect to business-, manufacturing-, supply chain-, and digital strategy. © 2018, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

abstract={Through the introduction of computers and the commercial rise of the internet over the past decades, the manufacturing industry has changed dramatically worldwide. The recent Industry 4.0 development, referred to as the increasing digitalisation and the interconnection of products, value chains and business models, is most likely to change not only the way we live but also the way products are manufactured. Manufacturing processes will become more autonomous, integrated and intelligent. This will further lead to changes in requirements for the manufacturing workforce towards an increasing need in software, programming and interdisciplinary skills. This study looks at what effects Industry 4.0 will or might have on the manufacturing process as well as on the skills and knowledge required from its workforce over the next decades. The study was carried out by reviewing respective literature and by conducting semi-structured interviews with experts, which revealed a number of insights into the impacts of Industry 4.0 within Germany’s manufacturing context. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The article emphasizes the relevance of the digital economy development as one of the most important directions of the fourth industrial revolution. It is significant for a breakthrough in science and technology, social and economic development. I prove that the industrial policy is a reliable instrument for supporting digital economy. The following factors define the priorities of industrial policy: the level of socio-economic development of the country, the existing model of economic development, an image of the country's future. I consider the evolution of the industrial policy priorities in Russia. In current situation, the essentially new priority is the support of digital economy. I find that pro-active digital economy formulation and management in collaboration of all branches of the government as well as the development of digital economy together with sector programmes and programmes of innovative development, etc. are of great importance. I have suggested steps, which could make the Industry Development Fund to support the new priorities connected with digital economy development. Furthermore, I have developed proposals on adjusting provisions, which define the possibility to apply special investment contracts for stimulating the digital economy development. I have defined the main directions of staffing the digital economy. The article emphasizes that «digital transformation of the industry» radically changes the idea targets and subjects of industrial policy. So-called related industries, as the association of goods, individuals, and technologies within the industrial system, the structures based on such special type of business models as technological platforms and the human needs become a new targets of the industrial policy. During the fourth industrial revolution, a system of interaction between federal and regional authorities and various business associations as well as civil society institutions becomes the main subject of industrial policy. This predetermines a multi-actor character of the industrial policy. The requirements to leaders of the state and business structures have increased. Therefore, their responsibility for preventing negative social and ethical consequences of the implementation of new technology solutions. © 2018 Economy of Region. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The fourth Industrial Revolution is opening unprecedented opportunities to solve some of the hardest social problems and, in the process, make significant business gains, However, scaling up these new solutions is not easy. Leading businesses will need to reinvent the way they do business to capture these opportunities, including addressing the risks and challenges posed by new technologies. The essential components of scaling up the new business model include being good at orchestrating an innovation ecosystem, defining the guiding principles to harness the collective intelligence of all the ecosystem players, and devising a methodology for successful execution from development and design to sustainable operations. This paper summarizes the position of Accenture on "Tech4Good" and provides actionable insights and guidance for businesses to scale up Tech4Good solutions. © 2018 CEUR-WS. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This study is devoted to the existing and future information technology that forms a base for concepts of Industry 4.0 and cyber-physical systems using examples of firms that apply this technology. Examples include manufacturing and transportation companies. The objective of this paper is to analyse the impact of intelligent information technologies in Industry 4.0 and cyber-physical systems on the enterprise management principles in near future. The transformation trends are illustrated on case-study examples. The literature and case-study analysis shows that enterprise management in manufacturing and transportation lacks understanding of Industry 4.0 and cyber-physical systems in terms of application to concrete business models. The reviews cases lead to the conclusion that the Industry 4.0 and cyber-physical technology applications are rather contextual and engineering-oriented. The implementation of the main principle of the Industry 4.0 and cyber-physical technology, i.e., the self-organisation and self-adaption of dynamic networked structures along the entire product lifecycle to ensure the flexible individual manufacturing at the mass production costs, has been yet applied very restrictively and mostly in research projects. The paper presents an original interpretation of the serviceoriented approach to modeling and solution of the information technology assessment and selection problems to facilitate a broader application in firms. This approach is based on the structural dynamics control theory developed by the authors. © 2018 St. Petersburg Institute for Informatics and Automation of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

abstract={Industry 4.0 and Logistics 4.0 are highly modern terms. They are connected with the common trend of digitalization, virtualization and networking of data and information. Typical is the implementation of new information and communication technologies into production and logistics practice. This will change the working conditions, processes as well as business models. “Industry 4.0” is the synonym for the 4th industrial revolution in a general understanding. The term “Industry 4.0” was first used in a high-tech-strategy project of the German government in 2011 at the Hannover Fair. (Compare [1, 2]) The paper describes the terms Industry 4.0 and Logistics 4.0 as two of the most important trends in production and logistics. It characterizes the big chances of this development. The paper gives an overview about important solutions in this area. (Compare [3]) Some new solutions are discussed according to material sciences, as it is also very important to develop and use new materials, which help to create smart solutions. Smart materials are created in the areas of e.g. laminated, composite and functionally graded materials, thermal and piezoelectric actuation, active and passive damping, vibrations and waves in smart structures. (Compare [4]) Smart materials allow the design and implementation of actuator, sensor fields and networks. Further examples are self-reporting materials, which autonomously report about problems and defects. This allows an evaluation and control of defects of components during their use and application.

abstract={The digital transformation of economies is one of the megatrends of today’s world. The advancing equipment of machines and products with sensors and connectivity as well as their intelligent interconnection among each other leads to a mergence between physical and virtual worlds. This development is not limited to smart production systems in terms of an “Industry 4.0” only, but will also affect the increasingly important service business of manufacturing companies. Regarding “Smart Services” (data-based bundles of services, digital applications and technologies), the development of appropriate business models is seen as a key challenge for companies. Our paper illustrates how the approach “Value Proposition Design” can support manufacturing firms to develop Smart Service Business Models. Thus, we present insights from an applied research project, in which two different Business Model alternatives have been derived from applying Value Proposition Design. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.},

abstract={Skilled shop-floor technicians are playing an important role in modern Industry 4.0 manufacturing environments, especially in small and customized manufacturing systems. Moving towards Industry 4.0 business models, it is essential to develop advanced solutions that will reinforce the position of technicians in manufacturing, by implementing key enabling technologies. Augmented Reality (AR) has arisen as a key enabling technology, which will enable the transfer of information from digitalized design systems and databases towards human operators, especially including production and maintenance information. Reinforced by the development of advanced communication technologies that support high speed data transfer, such as 5G, and networks that combine low latency with increased availability, such as tactile internet, AR proposes a way for agile information distribution and increased shop-floor status awareness.

abstract={Digitalization is radically impacting our economy and society. Everything is becoming more dynamic, more volatile and chinging at a tremendous pace. The ongoing developments especially in artificial intelligence and robotics, big data and machine learning as well as generative manufacturing and virtual reality are leading to the emergence of new digital business models and changes in work processes. New forms of human-technology interaction are everywhere - Industry 4.0 is the buzzword. Besides the potential for more process efficiency and higher productivity created in this context, companies in all industries see themselves confronted with increasing challenges with regard to innovation as well as completely new products and service offerings. It is clear the future of the working world will be different - and shaping this future is the task of all those players involved in the process. © 2018 Bauverlag BV GmbH. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Manufacturing industry profoundly impact economic and societal progress. As being a commonly accepted term for research centers and universities, the Industry 4.0 initiative has received a splendid attention of the business and research community. Although the idea is not new and was on the agenda of academic research in many years with different perceptions, the term “Industry 4.0” is just launched and well accepted to some extend not only in academic life but also in the industrial society as well. While academic research focuses on understanding and defining the concept and trying to develop related systems, business models and respective methodologies, industry, on the other hand, focuses its attention on the change of industrial machine suits and intelligent products as well as potential customers on this progress. It is therefore important for the companies to primarily understand the features and content of the Industry 4.0 for potential transformation from machine dominant manufacturing to digital manufacturing. In order to achieve a successful transformation, they should clearly review their positions and respective potentials against basic requirements set forward for Industry 4.0 standard. This will allow them to generate a well-defined road map. There has been several approaches and discussions going on along this line, a several road maps are already proposed. Some of those are reviewed in this paper. However, the literature clearly indicates the lack of respective assessment methodologies. Since the implementation and applications of related theorems and definitions outlined for the 4th industrial revolution is not mature enough for most of the reel life implementations, a systematic approach for making respective assessments and evaluations seems to be urgently required for those who are intending to speed this transformation up. It is now main responsibility of the research community to developed technological infrastructure with physical systems, management models, business models as well as some well-defined Industry 4.0 scenarios in order to make the life for the practitioners easy. It is estimated by the experts that the Industry 4.0 and related progress along this line will have an enormous effect on social life. As outlined in the introduction, some social transformation is also expected. It is assumed that the robots will be more dominant in manufacturing, implanted technologies, cooperating and coordinating machines, self-decision-making systems, autonom problem solvers, learning machines, 3D printing etc. will dominate the production process. Wearable internet, big data analysis, sensor based life, smart city implementations or similar applications will be the main concern of the community. This social transformation will naturally trigger the manufacturing society to improve their manufacturing suits to cope with the customer requirements and sustain competitive advantage. A summary of the potential progress along this line is reviewed in introduction of the paper. It is so obvious that the future manufacturing systems will have a different vision composed of products, intelligence, communications and information network. This will bring about new business models to be dominant in industrial life. Another important issue to take into account is that the time span of this so-called revolution will be so short triggering a continues transformation process to yield some new industrial areas to emerge. This clearly puts a big pressure on manufacturers to learn, understand, design and implement the transformation process. Since the main motivation for finding the best way to follow this transformation, a comprehensive literature review will generate a remarkable support. This paper presents such a review for highlighting the progress and aims to help improve the awareness on the best experiences. It is intended to provide a clear idea for those wishing to generate a road map for digitizing the respective manufacturing suits. By presenting this review it is also intended to provide a hands-on library of Industry 4.0 to both academics as well as industrial practitioners. The top 100 headings, abstracts and key words (i.e. a total of 619 publications of any kind) for each search term were independently analyzed in order to ensure the reliability of the review process. Note that, this exhaustive literature review provides a concrete definition of Industry 4.0 and defines its six design principles such as interoperability, virtualization, local, real-time talent, service orientation and modularity. It seems that these principles have taken the attention of the scientists to carry out more variety of research on the subject and to develop implementable and appropriate scenarios. A comprehensive taxonomy of Industry 4.0 can also be developed through analyzing the results of this review. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore how rising technologies from Industry 4.0 can be integrated with circular economy (CE) practices to establish a business model that reuses and recycles wasted material such as scrap metal or e-waste. Design/methodology/approach: The qualitative research method was deployed in three stages. Stage 1 was a literature review of concepts, successful factors and barriers related to the transition towards a CE along with sustainable supply chain management, smart production systems and additive manufacturing (AM). Stage 2 comprised a conceptual framework to integrate and evaluate the synergistic potential among these concepts. Finally, stage 3 validated the proposed model by collecting rich qualitative data based on semi-structured interviews with managers, researchers and professors of operations management to gather insightful and relevant information. Findings: The outcome of the study is the recommendation of a circular model to reuse scrap electronic devices, integrating web technologies, reverse logistics and AM to support CE practices. Results suggest a positive influence from improving business sustainability by reinserting waste into the supply chain to manufacture products on demand. Research limitations/implications: The impact of reusing wasted materials to manufacture new products is relevant to minimising resource consumption and negative environmental impacts. Furthermore, it avoids hazardous materials ending up in landfills or in the oceans, seriously threatening life in ecosystems. In addition, reuse of wasted material enables the development of local business networks that generate jobs and improve economic performance. Practical implications: First, the impact of reusing materials to manufacture new products minimises resource consumption and negative environmental impacts. The circular model also encourages keeping hazardous materials that seriously threaten life in ecosystems out of landfills and oceans. For this study, it was found that most urban waste is plastic and cast iron, leaving room for improvement in increasing recycling of scrap metal and similar materials. Second, the circular business model promotes a culture of reusing and recycling and motivates the development of collection and processing techniques for urban waste through the use of three-dimensional (3D) printing technologies and Industry 4.0. In this way, the involved stakeholders are focused on the technical parts of recycling and can be better dedicated to research, development and innovation because many of the processes will be automated. Social implications: The purpose of this study was to explore how Industry 4.0 technologies are integrated with CE practices. This allows for the proposal of a circular business model for recycling waste and delivering new products, significantly reducing resource consumption and optimising natural resources. In a first stage, the circular business model can be used to recycle electronic scrap, with the proposed integration of web technologies, reverse logistics and AM as a technological platform to support the model. These have several environmental, sociotechnical and economic implications for society. Originality/value: The sociotechnical aspects are directly impacted by the circular smart production system (CSPS) management model, since it creates a new culture of reuse and recycling techniques for urban waste using 3D printing technologies, as well as Industry 4.0 concepts to increase production on demand and automate manufacturing processes. The tendency of the CSPS model is to contribute to deployment CE in the manufacture of new products or parts with AM approaches, generating a new path of supply and demand for society. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Circular Economy has been usually indicated as a promising approach to promote economic development and sustainability. Despite this general agreement, the Circular Economy paradigm is still little adopted by companies, as they need to face several challenges. In this context, Product-Service Systems (PSS) Business Models play a major role, as they have been proposed as an opportunity for promoting sustainability. Today, digital technologies are seen as a key factor to enable PSS, allowing at the same time the introduction of Circular Economy into companies. However, little attention has been set on how new digital technologies can overcome in practice the main Circular Economy challenges. To fill this gap, this paper explores such a role through a case study of a company who leverages Internet of Things, Big Data and Analytics in the provision of its PSS Business Model. Based on the findings of the empirical investigation, the role that the selected digital technologies play in overcoming the Circular Economy challenges is presented and discussed. © 2018 The Authors.

abstract={The development of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) has induced large structural changes in societies, whose success is now associated with gaining and distributing knowledge. The concept of lifelong education has become one of the main principles of educational institutions around the world. The traditional ways of gaining and distributing knowledge have become insufficient and rigid, and in some cases of poor qualfiity CP. This is particularly true for the special as well as highly interdisciplinary knowledge and competences needed for interdisciplinary studies, such as Wood Science and Technology. Digitalisation of the educational process, the use of modern ICT and introduction via e-learning are some of the possible solutions to these problems. Additionally, they are all part of the concept of Industry 4.0, the implementation of which is the key to the development of the wood sector in Slovenia. New technologies and learning methods will stimulate the development of business models (e.g. virtualisation technologies in the sales/marketing process) in the wood industry, which will have a positive impact on the development of the whole wood sector and consequently increase demand for wood products. The goal of the research is to examine the best practices and technologies for digitalisation of education and to analyze the use of e-learning approaches and technologies in the higher education context of wood science in Slovenia. © 2018 Increasing the Use of Wood in the Global Bio-Economy - Proceedings of Scientific Papers.

abstract={In Germany, which economy is still based on the industrial sector, there are several highly competitive transnational companies. Over the last twenty years they have radically changed their business model and actively implement foreign expansion on the basis of foreign investment and global value chains. German TNCs focus on changes in the composition of owners and on the model of corporate governance. They actively adapt to changes in the external environment. The largest German TNCs mainly belong to the key industries of the third phase of industrial revolution, which are the most internationalized: the chemical / pharmaceutical industry; automotive, electrical engineering and partly electronics. The forthcoming industry 4.0 is changing competitive positions of many firms. The article analyzes the evolution of the development of German multinationals into global companies, their characteristics, competitive positions and development trends against the backdrop of digital revolution and globalization. © 2018 Institute of Europe Russian Academy of Sciences.

abstract={Healthcare organizations are currently in an era of significant digital transformation. Organizations are seeking to adapt within a globalized environment with ever-increasing complexity of care and regulatory requirements. To be successful in this new era, organizations must re-envision their value chain to improve patient outcomes, and be flexible and adaptable in their ability to respond to the competitive marketplace. The combination of traditional production and cyber-physical production will indicate the evolution from traditional business models to the emerging non-linear value chains. The aim of this paper is to review the healthcare value chain in the context of digitally-enabled technologies such as hyperledger and blockchain, which have the potential to extensively alter healthcare organizations. The research contributions include development of a reusable hyperchain artifact, construct development, and understanding the shift from the traditional healthcare value chain to the industry 4.0 digital healthcare value chain model instantiation of the hyperchain. © 2018 Association for Information Systems.

abstract={Cyber physical systems offer a vast variety of new possibilities in the context of the fourth industrial revolution, ‘Industrie 4.0’. Due to an increasing amount of more complex requirements for companies and the necessity of an implementation guideline of Industrie 4.0 technologies, a new approach for supporting small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) was developed: the 'Generic Procedure Model to Introduce Industrie 4.0' (GPMI4.0). Fields of action, adapted to their own enterprise, are identified to reach a higher level of Industrie 4.0. GPMI4.0s core method is the Industrie 4.0 toolbox which is divided in five phases: preparation, analysis, idea generation, validation and implementation. Toolboxes for the domain product, production, intralogistics, IT security and assembly are already published. However, in order to use technologies of Industrie 4.0 in more stages of the product life cycle, GPMI4.0 has to be applied to the not yet considered domain of engineering. This paper focuses on the development of a Toolbox for the domain of engineering regarding Industrie 4.0, analysing the product development process from the product idea to the manufacturing process. Using the Toolbox, the enterprises are able to analyse their engineering in the context of Industrie 4.0 and develop solutions to reach a higher level. The purpose of the engineering Toolbox is to generate an engineering competence profile by classifying the development state of every application level of an enterprise. Based on the profile the engineering Toolbox is used to advance the enterprise engineering competence regarding Industrie 4.0. The benefits are optimized inputs for the production field that can be used for the digital supply chain and for generating new business models. Finally, the suitability of the engineering Toolbox is validated by different companies and projects. © 2018 Newswood Limited. All rights reserved.},

abstract={If finance enables production, technology in the financial services sector enhances the speed of accessing and transferring finances, ultimately facilitating more production. Accepting new technologies is therefore crucial to the success of any industry in the fourth industrial revolution. Technologies such as Social Media, Mobile, Analytics (and Big Data), Cloud, along with the Internet of Things (SMACT/SMACIT), have become pervasive digital disruptors which have fundamentally changed the business models and value propositions of firms across industries. The financial services sector has been disrupted by innovations such as M-Pesa, SnapScan and EcoCash, which have made it more inclusive. The growing smartphone uptake in South Africa and developing countries has removed barriers to financial services provision and has reduced barriers to information access. SMACT technologies offer an opportunity for the financial services sector to reduce the costs of banking in such a way that those who are underserved or unserved by the financial services sector are more informed and better able to access financial services through the removal of geographic barriers to banking and through the reduction of costs. Chigada and Hirschfelder (2017:3) state that the integration of the banking system is part of the critical functions of mobile banking. Lower-income classes, despite having individually weaker purchasing power, actually have astoundingly significant purchasing power at the collective level (Chigada & Hirschfelder, 2017:3). Mobile banking therefore seeks to integrate into the banking system this poor yet large population who collectively possess significant market power. In order to integrate the poor into the financial services sector, the benefits of mobile banking have to be conveyed to them in a way that clearly indicates simplicity and convenience (Ramavhona & Mokwena, 2010:5; Al-Jabri & Sohail, 2012:387; Ernst & Young, 2016:6). This paper aims to assess the digital disruption from big data of the South African financial services sector with a particular focus on financial inclusion. The study used a mixed method approach. For the qualitative method, data was collected from semi-structured interviews with key informants from the financial services sector and related fields of expertise. © 2018 Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

abstract={The merging of services and digital technologies generates remarkable opportunities in manufacturing, by allowing more efficient processes, adding value to products, and supporting improved managerial decisions with richer, faster and sounder information. Although the importance of this phenomenon, the scientific knowledge is not sufficient. By analyzing the emerging trends of digitization and servitization in manufacturing we tried firstly to identify the key digital technologies to the servitization by studying different frameworks and the national industry 4.0 policy initiatives in Europe. Secondly to describe and explain if and how they enable this transformation. This paper aims specifically to provide a framework which is able to rationalize and systemize the existing knowledge on the topic by conducting a literature review. This study is considered as the first step of a research program on how these two megatrends are jointly disrupting resources, competences, skills and consequently business models. We show that the knowledge about how digital technologies support servitization in manufacturing is still at an early stage and rather limited so future research should aim at better understanding the links between digital and service transformation. Greater knowledge of the impacts of digital technologies on the servitization process will pave the way for the development of contingency models that can support and guide academics and practitioners alike. © 2018 The Authors.

abstract={This paper investigates the impact of the three mega-trends (1) digitalisation (2) sustainability and (3) servitisation on design and development capabilities in manufacturing companies. First, technological advancements have created both product opportunities, and new aids, captured in e.g. the Industry 4.0 paradigm, and intensively driving digitalisation of businesses, that, besides the technological challenges, cause new challenges and problem areas, such as information ownership and shared long-term responsibilities. Second, the need for sustainable solutions increases the focus on the design of circular, resource efficient and radically new technological solutions to be designed with a total life cycle perspective in mind, through use phase, repair and overhaul, until recycling and end-of-life. Third, and finally, the classical roles for suppliers, integrators and users are being changed as servitisation and Product-Service Systems (PSS) offerings affect both products and businesses, and ultimately entire value networks with new constellations of business partners contributing to the realization of solutions for customers. This paper builds on a conceptual literature review to identify relevant information about the three trends regarding their impact on design and societal development. In addition, a semi-structured interview study was conducted to investigate possibilities and challenges that four different types of manufacturing companies perceive today with respect to the mega-trends, and more specifically how these trends impact the design and development capabilities in the studied companies. Results from this empirical study show that digitalisation is viewed as an opportunity to find new solutions to meet customer needs and be competitive at the future market. Sustainable Product Development (SPD) was instead primarily to fulfil requirements and legislation. However, it was clear that some manufacturers start to see market forces as a driver. PSS can be seen as a means to create new solutions, often with digital tools as facilitator. Altogether, the literature study and the empirical data show that increasingly, designers are expected to design entire solutions, as opposed to merely artefacts. This implies that designers need to consider not only the product performance and cost, but products' and solutions' behaviour and impact over complete life cycles, developed and organized by business networks together with several suppliers and other partners with different capabilities. The basis for the designer is a technology mix comprising services, software, electronics and hardware, bundled into offerings in new business models, interlinked with new digital opportunities. Moreover, it is clear that the three trends do not represent stand-alone perspectives but affect one another in an intertwined way. To achieve long-term effects, the sustainability issues need to be integrated with many other subject areas, and implemented simultaneously as digital solutions, e.g. digital twins to physical artefacts are conceived, and value creating networks are being built up. Obviously, these three trends affect the need for change in product design capabilities and escalate the challenges of the integrated product development viewpoint, in a way that is difficult to master for individual engineers. Support for design and development work is needed that takes into account the mega-trends digitalisation, sustainability, and servitisation. © Proceedings of NordDesign: Design in the Era of Digitalization, NordDesign 2018.

abstract={The industrial domain is experiencing a so-called fourth industrial revolution in which the evergrowing complexity of manufacturing information, the increasing amount of knowledge and the use of web-oriented techniques, represent three crucial factors that are accelerating the growth of complexity of industrial systems. On the other hand, continuous-evolving requirements in industrial environments, due to technology outbreaks and a new global marketplace, have led to an on-going evolution of human resource management through the creation and adoption of alternative business models. In the past decade, semantic models such as ontologies have been proven to be effective for many knowledge-intensive applications, since they provide formal models of domain knowledge that can be exploited in different ways. For all these reasons, an innovative human resource optimisation (HRO) engine is introduced, which employs semantically enhanced information and conditional random field (CRFs) probabilistic models with knowledge derived from industrial shop floor level, and proposes the right person for the right job in real-time shop floor operations towards optimising decisions on how to implement and schedule either repeatedly or non-occurring tasks. Industrial information data flow and semantic enrichment were ensured through the combined use of a common interface data exchange model (CIDEM) and ontologies, after which a feasibility study at a chemical plant presented interesting preliminary results. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group},

abstract={The emergence of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) poses a large impact on established business models of manufacturing companies. This study aims at analyzing the influence of the IIoT on these business models from a business level perspective. In particular, it focuses on the interrelationships between business model component changes. While the sparse body of extant management literature examines just a subset of business model elements as affected by the IIoT, a framework comprising an entire set of elements is provided. Besides, their direct and indirect interrelationships, and the most important changes in each of the elements, are investigated. For this purpose, an exploratory multiple case study approach is employed, which is based on relevant IIoT-related experiences of 76 German manufacturing companies. By triangulating data from semi-structured expert interviews and archival company material, the study provides in-depth insights and a better understanding of IIoT-driven effects on manufacturing business models. It contributes to extant management literature by revealing the value proposition, internal infrastructure management, and customer relationships predominantly influenced by the IIoT. Moreover, it is shown that IIoT-triggered business model changes are offer-driven, particularly by production and process optimization within customers' production systems. These value proposition changes result in subsequent modifications of the remaining business model elements. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The fourth industrial revolution, Industry 4.0, is expected to cause disruptive changes in industrial production. It is driven by rapid technological developments and the need for manufacturing companies to make themselves independent of high labor costs. Industry 4.0 concerns several aspects of industrial production, including manufacturing logistics, business models and products and services. The applications of Industry 4.0 have been vastly outlined. However, the fit of Industry 4.0 applications in different production environments is not clear. The purpose of this paper is to identify and investigate the Industry 4.0 technologies that are applicable to manufacturing logistics, and how the production environment influences the applicability of these technologies. This is done through a multiple case study of four Norwegian manufacturing companies. The findings from the study indicate that the applicability of Industry 4.0 in manufacturing logistics is dependent on the production environment. Companies with a low degree of production repetitiveness see less potential in applying Industry 4.0 technologies in manufacturing logistics, while companies with a highly repetitive production see a higher potential. © 2017, Shanghai University and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The hype concerning digitalization is increasing the demand for new generations of automation systems. Concepts like Reference Architecture Model Industry 4.0 (RAMI 4.0) give us models but do not tell us how to facilitate actual implementations. This article discusses the transition from legacy automation technology as defined by ISA-95 to highly distributed Internet of Things (IoT)-and system of systems (SoS)-based automation systems that fully utilize Internet technologies, thus enabling the implementation of Industry 4.0 and RAMI 4.0 models. Distributed IoT automation systems have a number of general requirements concerning real-time performance, security, engineering cost, scalability, and interoperability. Meeting these requirements is necessary to enable possibilities for a realworld implementation of IoT automation. A key concept is local automation clouds. The discussion is based on a particular example of such an automation integration platform, the Arrowhead Framework. © 2007-2011 IEEE.},

abstract={The growing prevalence of technology-driven concepts, such as the "Internet of things" or "Industry 4.0", holds substantial potentials for service sectors worldwide. In this context, "Smart Services" describe data-based, individually configurable bundles of physically delivered services, digital services as well as physical products, which are usually performed on integrated platforms. Due to their complexity and the integration of data from customers and other stakeholders as a key resource for value creation, Smart Services are performed in complex Ecosystems (e.g. in collaboration between technology, software as well as service specialists and users). However, Value Co-creation in Smart Service Ecosystems requires an adaption of stakeholderś existing business models. Smart Service platforms need to consider value contributions of other actors, when defining their business models and vice versa.

abstract={Intelligent industry and manufacturing requires obtaining relevant sensor data and process information in real-time from all components in the manufacturing value-chain. It is envisioned that smart industry is achieved by embedding connectivity into industrial products, using Cloud and Internet-of-things (IoT) to leverage intelligence and actionable knowledge for machines, autonomous collaboration among machines, and integration of products and additional value-added services. For complex industrial systems, it is important to ensure a smooth transformation towards the smart industry vision despite of the associated challenges with respect to e.g., transition from the traditional multi-layered architecture to an open structured service-oriented automation system architecture, changes of business models and strategies, legacy system migration to cloud environment, etc. The focus of this study is therefore to examine the status of the existing research on cloud computing and IoT solutions that enable this transformation towards a smart industry. We applied the systematic mapping study method to obtain an overview of the existing related research literatures that focus on smart industry, industrial automation and manufacturing perspective. We also discuss the future research areas that need to be enhanced. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Along with the fourth Industrial Revolution, the manufacturing industry is pursuing the differentiation from the previous manufacturing system, seeking profit via not only producing the goods but also servitizing the products. However, there are rare cases that customer oriented service is developed and provided by integrating the product and the service to provide the maximum utility to customers, in a situation where new services, such as Internet of Things(IoT), are created by connecting tangible and intangible objects. This study tried to find the innovative direction for manufacturing by developing smart plug with networking function using service design approach. At discovery phase, business model canvas was used to clarify the smart plug business environment, and at definition phase, total 14 service concepts were drawn to provide the direction of service. Also, 32 scenarios were created to expend service concept to various forms at the development phase, and lastly, at delivery phase, 10 smart plug services that will be feasible in near future were proposed. Covering customer value and needs, this study result will become a meaningful reference when planning service of a product with great touch point. © 2017 International Information Institute.},

abstract={Economists believe that we are entering the Post-Information Age, which is expected to succeed the current Information Age as the principal engine of economic activity. In this paper the authors assess this statement and how this impacts Information and Communications Technology (ICT)'s approach to meeting the needs of the digital transformation in business and society. The demands of systems such as 1) the Internet of Things (IoT), especially sensor networks and their deployment 2) 'Industry 4.0' and its competitiveness 3) the application of intelligent technologies to the major infrastructures (big cities, ports, airports, energy grids, etc.), will not be delivered through small projects but rather will be built around complex partnerships and ecosystems. Moving from this assessment, the authors look more closely also at the means of constructing a business case for new communications solutions, noting that the Post-Information Age will create new opportunities for Network Service Providers (NSPs). In doing this, they will examine key differences in the way offerings are constructed for the whole market sector, from consumer to major corporate / central Government solutions. According to the results found, it looks as if the same techniques apply to all segments, but with different weights and different approaches to the construction of key parameters for the specific value-proposition. The authors are strongly convinced that modelling the business case, partnership options and ecosystems remain the most powerful tools in assessing digital service viability. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Although that Cloud infrastructures are nowadays available, there is a lack ofadoption by companies. While big companies with large computing devisionsadopted the Cloud paradigm, small and midsize enterprises (SME) with a limitednumber of computer experts were scared by the complexity of the technology and by the huge investement to move to Cloud. But even for SMEs, the migration to Cloud infrastructure and the consequent usage of Open Sourcetechnology build the basement for future-proof IT systems in the era of theInternet-of-Things and Industry 4.0. At the same time, the business models ofsmall companies in the handcraft sector like carpentry are changing too. Although their customers require personalized and sustainable products, theproduction is using more industrial like technologies and processes. TheAQUASI project builds currently framework for SMEs using Open Source technology based on existing OSGi components to enable these companies to migrate their IT systems to the Cloud, to improve the communication and production processbetween collaborating partners, to collect data from IoT-sensorsfor further data analysis and by providing an analytical system to guaranteequality of sustainable products for more than 10 decades.

abstract={The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is the industrial subset of the Internet of Things (IoT). IIoT incorporates big data technology, harnessing the instrumentation data, machine to machine communication and automation technologies that have existed in industrial settings for years. As industry in general trends towards the IIoT and as the screw compressor packages developed by Howden Compressors are designed with a minimum design life of 25 years, it is imperative this technology is embedded immediately. This paper provides the reader with a description on the Industrial Internet of Things before moving onto describing the scope of the problem for an organisation like Howden Compressors who deploy multiple compressor technologies across multiple locations and focuses on the critical measurements particular to high specification screw compressor packages. A brief analysis of how this differs from high volume package manufacturers deploying similar systems is offered. Then follows a description on how the measured information gets from the tip of the instrument in the process pipework or drive train through the different layers, with a description of each layer, into the final presentation layer. The functions available within the presentation layer are taken in turn and the benefits analysed with specific focus on efficiency and availability. The paper concludes with how packagers adopting the IIoT can not only optimise their package but by utilising the machine learning technology and pattern detection applications can adopt completely new business models. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Industry 4.0 heralds the profound transformation of business models by enabling the fusion of virtual and real worlds and the application of digitization, automatization and robotics in manufacturing. We review the basic premises of Industry 4.0 and map them against the clusters’ features with the aim to establish the kind of relations between these two categories. By exploring the likely impact of clusters on Industry 4.0, our discussion revolves around the broader question of the role of regional ecosystems in industrial transformation. Clusters, thanks to the advantages such as knowledge base and mechanisms, agglomeration economies and externalities (labour pool and critical mass of firms) and favourable more stable, less uncertain environment of trust and cooperation, may facilitate the digital transformation, particularly its phasing-in and testing phases. Notwithstanding this potential, it should be stressed that not all clusters would be able to play such prominent role. Only these equipped with adequate knowledge base and providing some expertise in the field of IT solutions, robotics, automatics, and so on, i.e. the technologies crucial to Industry 4.0 seem predestined to contribute to the emergence of fully fledged industrial internet. Despite seemingly some inconsistency between these two categories, clusters can facilitate the business transformation towards Industry 4.0. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Industry 4.0 Business Model Innovation for SMEs – Nine-Field Matrix and Morphological Analysis for the Identification and the Design of Information-based Industry 4.0 Business Models for SMEs. The fourth industrial revolution, also known as Industry 4.0, is one of the greatest challenges small and medium-sized enterprises are facing today and in the future. Many of them have been market leaders for decades and have successfully optimized their products and services in an „offline world“. The integration of smart products and services with respect to Industry 4.0 offers new opportunities and levels to create value in the value chain. The identification of these dormant values and the development of new business models are a major obstacle for SMEs today. This article therefore presents a TRIZ-derived Nine-field matrix and a morphological analysis method to support SMEs in information-based Industry 4.0 business model development based on existing products and services.

Interaction is built on usage of digital technologies and is intensified along the whole chain of added value creation. In this connection, the ideas, concepts and technologies of Industry 4.0 have been put into practice directly and efficiently. But Industry 4.0 is a continuous process that should serve to development of specific business model and achieving success at customer, thereby it can't be a goal in itself of the technological development. Until today business processes of Hoesch Hohenlimburg were restricted by the framework of its own enterprise. But the project "Variation of production process for medium wide strip", ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) and MES (Manufacturing Execution System) systems have been introduced and the custoners are able now to register directly their orders in the system of Hoesch Hohenlimburg to provide digital business.},

The devices use Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to become connected and smart. The next stage is to use the astonishing advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) to make the devices intelligent. This digital fourth industrial revolution creates tremendous opportunities but also pitfalls. There is a need for a clear model of the intelligent consumer electronics technology, market and industry. We present here a paradigm of the digital home as organic ecosystem - a hierarchical organization of digital servants modeled after the Victorian manor. Using this paradigm we predict some major developments and new business models and opportunities. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents our architectural approach to building a collaborative Industry 4.0 platform that enables IoT-based real-time monitoring, optimization and negotiation in manufacturing supply chains. The platform is called NIMBLE and is currently being developed in a European research project. The presented approach utilizes microservice technology, and implements the core business functionality of the platform through a composition of decentralized, scalable services. The communication among services, and with platform users, manufacturers, suppliers, sensors and Web resources, is supported through simple protocols and lightweight mechanisms. Core business services of the implemented architecture are released as open source software, enabling multiple prospective platform-providers to establish B2B marketplaces for collaboration within their own industrial sector or region. To demonstrate microservices in practice, we present two scenarios, both related to manufacturing of wooden home buildings: one is IoT-based data sharing in a supply chain, and the other deals with product driven logistics planning. The further development of the platform will be driven by the requirements of at least four different use cases throughout Europe, and by incorporating advanced business models to support the growth of powerful network effects of the platform. © 2017 IEEE.},

For companies it is necessary to master the digital transformation, new innovations have to be developed. Furthermore, digitalization / Industry 4.0 linking the real-life factory with virtual reality, will play an increasingly important role in global manufacturing. Companies have to obtain new digital capabilities, in order to make their company sustainable for the future.

abstract={Re-industrialization enjoys a renaissance in Western economies due to the role of the industrial sector for innovation, productivity, and job creation. A very promising approach to bring back competitiveness in production seems to be the fusion of the virtual and the real world leading to smart manufacturing and logistics concepts. In Germany, the leading industrial country in the European Union this approach has been called “Industry 4.0” aiming to develop cyber-physical systems (CPS) and dynamic production networks in order to achieve flexible and open value chains in manufacturing of complex mass customization products in small series. Currently, manufacturing companies gaining experiences in production in networks and smart logistics and develop new organisational structures and business models which better benefit from the new technologies and which adapt faster to the rapidly changing network environments. The modern manufacturing models embrace modular and fractal approaches as well as network-orientation, flexibility and responsiveness. The paper investigates the relationship between networking, organizational development, structural frame conditions and sustainability in the context of Industry 4.0. The research is empirically validated by using data samples from a business reengineering project in an internationally operating high-tech manufacturing enterprise located in Estonia. The empiric analysis is based on semi-structured expert interviews and secondary data together with a case study approach. © 2017 by author(s) and VsI Entrepreneurship and Sustainability Center.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) provides huge opportunities for organisations developing new business models supported by interconnected product, service and software systems. Due to the complexity of IoT systems, the understanding and development of attractive new system functions is a great challenge compared with traditional, stand-alone product systems. Methods that focus on the integration of market and business analysis with product design and development emerged from Japan in the late 1960s under the title of Quality Function Deployment (QFD). These have undergone considerable development over the last 30 years to ensure they are appropriate for the development of both complex hardware, software and service systems and the current best practices are described in the recently published ISO 16355 for QFD. Recent significant progress in development of cognitive artificial intelligence (AI) systems such as IBM's Watson system, provides opportunities to gather and analyse significant volumes of market and technological information to support the core objectives of QFD i.e. aligning new product system design to customer and stakeholder priorities. This involves targeting information sources, refining analysis algorithms to ensure market priorities with associated underlying trends are identified reliably. In this paper, background concepts related to QFD are discussed and the areas where cognitive AI can have most significant impact on the QFD approach towards design and development of IoT systems will be covered. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper provides evidence of the effects of Industry 4.0 technologies on the creation of new businesses by addressing the question: how is 3D printing (3DP) leading to the development of new business models? To this end, I discuss the elements of a business model and the features of Industry 4.0 and 3DP, and I contrast and analyze previous literature regarding the effects of 3DP on business models. Afterwards, I describe the qualitative method (multiple case study) used to gather, compile, and analyze the influence of 3DP on the business models of 25 enterprises. This analysis shows that 3DP may be influencing the development of whole new businesses and business models. Moreover, it is affecting differently the business models of existing enterprises. This paper also explores the concepts of technology complementarity and service complementarity, which seem to be the core elements of the success of enterprises centered on 3DP. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={In this article, we argue that the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) offers new opportunities and harbours threats that companies are not able to address with existing business models. Entrepreneurship and Transaction Cost Theories are used to explore the conditions for designing nonownership business models for the emerging IIoT with its implications for sharing uncertain opportunities and downsides, and for transforming these uncertainties into business opportunities. Nonownership contracts are introduced as the basis for business model design and are proposed as an architecture for the productive sharing of uncertainties in IIoT manufacturing networks. The following three main types of IIoT-enabled business models were identified: (1) Provision of manufacturing assets, maintenance and repair, and their operation, (2) innovative information and analytical services that help manufacturing (e.g. based on artificial intelligence (AI), big data, and analytics), and (3) new services targeted at end users (e.g. offering efficient customisation by integrating end users into the manufacturing and supply chain ecosystem). © 2016 Westburn Publishers Ltd.},

abstract={Manufacturing is undergoing a period of intense change as a result of advanced smart technologies, such as real-time sensors and the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). This has paved the way for a new era of digitized manufacturing known as Industry 4.0. It is anticipated that Industry 4.0 will be disruptive enough to present both new opportunities and threats to firms within a new competitive landscape. Manufacturers will be forced to adopt new business models to effectively capture value from the emerging smart technologies. A literature review revealed that few studies have addressed business models for Industry 4.0. Hence, this research addresses: What fundamental principles should companies in the manufacturing industry consider when adopting a data-driven business model? An analysis of four case studies on data-driven business models revealed significant common attributes. Through a SWOT analysis, twelve model principles for implementing a data-driven value capture framework could be identified. © 2017 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Along with increased digitalization, virtualization of processes and automation in industry, Industrial Internet of Things opens for new possible scenarios and business models. The opportunities of this technology rely, among the others, on new way for data and knowledge management. Knowledge Based Engineering (KBE) is greatly considered to support design activities related to digital technologies. The paper aims at analyzing the role of Industrial Internet of Things for supporting maintenance operations and evaluating whether the adoption of data structure and the integration with the KBE system can face the actual gaps and needs. After a brief overview of different technologies for knowledge management, a possible scenario has been identified. It represents the framework within IIoT technologies can be applied. This conceptual environment considers a multilevel structure: local facilities, the whole company, suppliers, retailers and global network have been involved into the analysis. Upon that scenario, how data and knowledge can be mapped and managed for each level have been investigated. Moreover, these data can be used to improve the predictive maintenance model as well as to enhance the design of new products through the acquisition and monitoring of an effective set of parameters. Finally, in order to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach with the use of simulation as well as physical devices, a prototypical application related to the maintenance of refrigerated display cabinets has been developed.

abstract={The global industrial landscape has changed deeply in the last few years due to successive technological developments and innovations in manufacturing processes. The Industry 4.0 concept has emerged and the academic literature has paid an increased attention to this topic, which remains non-consensual or ill defined. In this research, a literature review is made to understand this concept in its technological dimension, and to comprehend its impacts. This new industrial paradigm brings together the digital and physical worlds through the Cyber-Physical Systems enhanced by Internet of Things and it is expected that this novel has consequences on industry, markets and economy, improving production processes and increasing productivity, affecting the whole product lifecycle, creating new business models, changing the work environment and restructuring the labor market. Therefore, this paper focuses on Industry 4.0 concept and contributes for its clarification and further understanding about the importance and implications of this complex technological system. © 2017 The Author(s)},

abstract={The fourth industrial revolution, so-called Industry 4.0 is triggered by digitalization of manufacturing industries. According to global studies, Industry 4.0 will have significant positive impact in sense of revenue and cost reduction, but it will trigger also change and transformation of business, and the only actors, who can keep up with this transformation, and come up with innovative business models, can take advantages of this revolution. The value proposition proposed in those business models, nowadays are created collaboratively with using several intellectual properties, targeting characteristics of complex and relatively new market structures. We propose a model-driven approach and a corresponding toolkit, so-called “Business Modelling Infrastructure” that supports those actors during configuring their value propositions and business models, with knowing which characteristics of which market segment they are targeting and what kind of intellectual properties do they need to use and what are their dependencies and limitations. The work in the hand presents also a business modelling case for additive manufacturing, where the Business Modelling Infrastructure is applied. Finally, the work evaluates the Business Modelling Infrastructure with giving preliminary results from that business modelling case. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

abstract={Companies are currently preparing for the fourth industrial revolution, which is envisioned to radically change manufacturing processes, logistics and business models in global manufacturing networks. Previous research have emphasized the need to respond to the changing landscape of the digital economy in dynamic and innovative ways. This study aims at exploring how small and medium-sized companies are prepared to meet this opportunity and challenge. In order to do this we have applied insights from innovation theories and empirical findings from eight companies that are part of two industrial clusters. The findings in this study indicate that even though most of the case companies have ambitions to position themselves in a new digital landscape, they prepare themselves differently. We see that organizations that has progressed furthest in implementing Industry 4.0 related concepts are the ones that make actively use of their external network in cooperation and sharing knowledge. These companies also have managed the balance between exploration and exploitation internally, where employees are both engaged in efficient manufacturing of existing products and product development. Consequently, we claim that both openness and organizational ambidexterity is vital for successful implementation of Industry 4.0. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2017.},

abstract={In the Industry 4.0 world that is digitalizing and automating, sustainable business models exist but have not become mainstream. Opportunities for sustainable offerings exist by designing products for longevity, repair and recycling, such that sustainability is not only focusing on being more efficient, but also on using less raw materials and recycling more products. This changes the value proposition, supply chain, relation with the customer and financial justification of a business model. This paper discusses potential sustainable business scenarios, and proposes an agenda for research into how Industry 4.0 can be used to create sustainable business models. © 2017 The Authors.

abstract={Industry 4.0 can be said to be the current trend of automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies. Originally, the term "Industrie 4.0" is from a project in the high-tech strategy of the German government, which hope to promote the computerization of manufacturing. Usually involves terms like cyber-physical systems, Internet of things, amd cloud computing. For now, Industry 4.0 becomes an emerging buzzword that is gaining significant interest among all stakeholders of the global industry-related R&D market from academia to international companies. It is a new business model attracting much interest, yet the definitions are not very matured and is an amazing melting pot of disruptive technologies. No doubt, to maximize the impact of Industry 4.0, researchers from different fields and industry have to work together applying the new technologies in practice. On the top of the wave, it is timely to analyze the cross section who can benefit from the novel achievements of Industry 4.0.},

abstract={Industry is facing a historic turning point [1]. In industry 4.0, people, machines and products communicate with one another via the internet. This means the convergence of industry and Internet technology. Modern machines allow companies to exploit the potential of digitalization in their production facilities and to unlock new business fields. The mechanical engineering sector have to know how new technologies can be successfully integrated for the benefit of the customer. Production processes and supply chains will become more efficient, with advances in productivity and huge savings in material and energy. Digitalization goes hand in hand with the growing importance of platforms for data exchange, customer contact and services. Online platforms facilitate market access, reduce transaction costs and enable innovation through new business models. Machines are connected around the world, so Industry 4.0 would not be possible without networks and data traffic. © 2017 The Author(s)},

abstract={Industry 4.0 is an important trend aiming at increasing competitiveness and rebalancing value creation in global networks. It targets the reduction of production costs while improving product quality and production scalability and individualization by means of digitalization of product and production. Products as well as their production are becoming cognitive and can therefore better adapt to given customer needs or production variations. In this paper, we discuss impacts of Industry 4.0 along the entire automotive supply chain. In particular, we illustrate that Industry 4.0 in the automotive context has a high cross-impact between development, production, operation and maintenance, thus requiring innovative solutions along the entire value creation chain. We enhance the commonly understood scope of Industry 4.0 towards digitalization over the entire product lifecycle and introduce data-driven business models to support exploitation of opportunities coming from this digitalization over the supply chain. We also propose a seamless cost engineering discipline in the automotive context for enabling a more systematic analysis and monitoring of the foreseen production costs from early development phase until SOP. This leverages system optimization to fulfil customer expectations from a functional, contextual and from an affordability point of view. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.},

abstract={Smart Industries, known as Industry 4.0, are becoming very important for researchers, manufacturers, and media since 2011. The globalization of the markets and mass customization force enterprises to review their business models as well as their manufacturing practices in order to improve their competitiveness. Digital technologies, service-oriented approaches, and process automation lead to more agility, efficiency, performance, and improvement within enterprises. The purpose of this paper is to provide a portrait of Quebec SMEs in order to understand their strengths and weaknesses, and to measure their readiness to keep up with Industry 4.0. A literature review and an analysis based on a database of 148 Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) in Quebec showed that a sustained sharing of knowledge between academics and manufacturers as well as the adoption of incentive and investment policies in digital technologies would aid in better developing the manufacturing sector in Quebec.},

abstract={This book describes how the creation of new digital services-through vertical and horizontal integration of data coming from sensors on top of existing legacy systems-that has already had a major impact on industry is now extending to healthcare. The book describes the fourth industrial revolution (i.e. Health 4.0), which is based on virtualization and service aggregation. It shows how sensors, embedded systems, and cyber-physical systems are fundamentally changing the way industrial processes work, their business models, and how we consume, while also affecting the health and care domains. Chapters describe the technology behind the shift of point of care to point of need and away from hospitals and institutions; how care will be delivered virtually outside hospitals; that services will be tailored to individuals rather than being designed as statistical averages; that data analytics will be used to help patients to manage their chronic conditions with help of smart devices; and that pharmaceuticals will be interactive to help prevent adverse reactions. The topics presented will have an impact on a variety of healthcare stakeholders in a continuously global and hyper-connected world. Presents explanations of emerging topics as they relate to e-health, such as Industry 4.0, Precision Medicine, Mobile Health, 5G, Big Data, and Cyber-physical systems;. Provides overviews of technologies in addition to possible application scenarios and market conditions;. Features comprehensive demographic and statistic coverage of Health 4.0 presented in a graphical manner. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.},

abstract={Globalization, Industry 4.0 and increasing price pressure are only a few impact factors influencing the competition in capital goods industry. Thus, the manufacturers need to differentiate by creating individual bundles, consisting of technical products and lifecycle-oriented services, called Product-Service Systems (PSS). There is an increasing demand of availability-oriented PSS, in which the manufacturer guarantees the availability of the technical product and takes over a part of the customer's manufacturing risk. PSS can be offered by means of different business models. This article presents a novel concept to develop availability-oriented business models, which considers requirement elicitation for technical development of smart machine components, and customer-oriented methods of design thinking approach, i.e. Persona analysis, Value-network mapping and Customer Journey. The concept was validated in three use cases, regarding technology-push and market-pull perspective. © 2017 The Authors.},

abstract={Within the concept of Industry 4.0 the expansion of mechatronic products towards smart products is key. Whereas the discussion about smart products in the context of production is more prominent, the shift towards the paradigm of smart products also suggests that the current way of product development needs to be adapted fundamentally. It becomes obvious that besides technological topics like big-data or IT-infrastructure, the human factor is of major importance for a successful realization of industry 4.0. Especially new concepts for training and further education for product development are needed to cope with the emerging challenges. In order to design new educational concepts, instructional goals are key. Nowadays these goals are described in a competence oriented way. Until now, there are now competence models available that consider both the specificity of product development as well as the context of Smart Products. Hence this paper aims at deriving this competence model in a conceptual way. Therefore, a multistaged approach is conducted that synthesizes competence models for product development and engineering for industry 4.0 as well as design methodologies in the field.},

abstract={A fourth industrial revolution is occurring in global manufacturing. It is based on the introduction of Internet of things and servitization concepts into manufacturing companies, leading to vertically and horizontally integrated production systems. The resulting smart factories are able to fulfill dynamic customer demands with high variability in small lot sizes while integrating human ingenuity and automation. To support the manufacturing industry in this conversion process and enhance global competitiveness, policy makers in several countries have established research and technology transfer schemes. Most prominently, Germany has enacted its Industrie 4.0 program, which is increasingly affecting European policy, while the United States focuses on smart manufacturing. Other industrial nations have established their own programs on smart manufacturing, notably Japan and Korea. This shows that manufacturing intelligence has become a crucial topic for researchers and industries worldwide. The main object of these activities are the so-called cyber-physical systems (CPS): physical entities (e.g., machines, vehicles, and work pieces), which are equipped with technologies such as RFIDs, sensors, microprocessors, telematics or complete embedded systems. They are characterized by being able to collect data of themselves and their environment, process and evaluate these data, connect and communicate with other systems, and initiate actions. In addition, CPS enabled new services that can replace traditional business models based solely on product sales. The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of the Industrie 4.0 and smart manufacturing programs, analyze the application potential of CPS starting from product design through production and logistics up to maintenance and exploitation (e.g., recycling), and identify current and future research issues. Besides the technological perspective, the paper also takes into account the economic side considering the new business strategies and models available. © 2017, Fuji Technology Press.

abstract={The fourth industrial revolution (Industrie 4.0) is distinguished by a growing network and intelligence of machines, products, services and data. This results in new business models and value chains, but also various risks, e.g. by hacker attacks, data theft or manipulation. Many companies consider Industrie 4.0 much as a security challenge other than an opportunity or enabler for new business models. Therefore, effective security methods to protect the Industrie 4.0 systems and its associated values and assets are needed. One of the aims of Industrie 4.0 is identifying and developing new, appropriate security practices for enterprises and especially for their production systems. Based on the connectivity infrastructure in the shop floor, the diversity in the corporate landscape of the global mechanical and plant engineering ultimately causes that every company has to develop its own way of IT and production security management. In the context of Industrie 4.0, an integral concept is needed, that connects the requirements from manufacturing automation and mechanical engineering to process engineering with the properties of cyber-physical systems as an Industrie 4.0 component and well-established core elements of IT security descriptions. Standards from industry associations and standardization committees have to be included. In this paper, a process model is developed, which consults RAMI 4.0 and well-established core elements of safety and IT security considering the standards IEC 61508 and IEC 62443. A use case driven approach is developed with the goal to demonstrate the functionalities and validation of the process model. In different iterations, the dynamic change of the system by mapping IT security requirements on system assets and processes will be presented. The purpose of the developed process model is to assign security measures to vulnerabilities and threats of a system for Industrie 4.0. © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier.},

abstract={Digitalization is a global change affecting a variety of social conditions and businesses. In addition to changing products and services in businesses and the labour market, digitalization will also create radically new business models in many industries. In parallel to the concept “Industry 4.0”, the paper introduce “Rail 4.0” and “Transport 4.0” as a technological revolution in contemporary rail transport. In Norway, Bane NOR SF will change the existing signalling system with the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) for the entire rail network and introduce a new national Traffic Management System (TMS). This leads to several significant challenges as well as opportunities. The aim of this paper is to highlight key challenges and opportunities of digitalization of the rail network, traffic management and design of traffic control centres. The paper summarizes some experiences from other sectors and relevant stakeholders with regard to traffic control and monitoring. Possibilities and chal-lenges of assessing, planning and constructing new rail TMS and control centres are discussed. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, London.},

abstract={Demographic and socio-economic changes in large parts of the world enforcing change to health care systems as we know them. While our societies are ageing and thus require more health services the number of hospital beds, at least in Europe, is decreasing, while at the same time the point of care is shifting towards outpatient departments, doctor’s surgeries, care homes, patient homes and-the Internet. Buzz words such as Individualized Medicine, Precision Medicine mHealth and lately the 5th generation mobile networks are driving a trend towards virtualization and a transition from manufacturing, for example of pharmaceutical products, to service provision. Pharmaceutical companies are aiming at the provision of holistic services including data processing with algorithms, case management and billing. However, this must not be confused with the business models of health maintenance organizations (HMOs) in the United States but needs to be understood as a paradigm shift in the health industry driven by new technologies and strategies. One of these fundamentally new strategies is Industry 4.0, which is not only restricted to manufacturing industries but seems to scale well into the health domain. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.},

abstract={Grinding is often the final step in the process/manufacturing chain, meaning that no subsequent post-grinding correction of the surface and geometry is performed. This imposes strong requirements on grinding-machine technology and on the understanding of this finalising process. While grinding has unique capabilities it is nevertheless in competition with other machining processes. The evolution of grinding machines is driven by process requirements like accuracy, MRR, and subsurface integrity. The regeneration of the tool on the machine with dressing devices is to be regarded as unique for grinding machines, hence a grinding machine always runs two separate processes. The high accuracy of grinding has, in fact, been an obstacle to simply adopting developments from other machining processes. Also, a lack of experienced machinists and a general trend towards individualized products and one-piece flow has required a transition from an experience-based approach to a science-based approach. Development is further driven by market demands, such as cost-reduction in terms of CAPEX, footprint, TCO versus quality, and throughput, which affect business models and the machine's design and construction. Moreover, the current mega-trends – such as resource efficiency, individualization, ergonomics and Industry 4.0 – are changing the appearance of grinding machines, which is also affected by the availability of new technologies, especially sensors, actuators and the control or machine intelligence. This paper reviews the most-relevant technologies, assesses their impact and the readiness of industry to adopt them, identifies the still-open issues, and concludes with future research requirements. © 2017},

abstract={The Industrial Internet of Things is recently a widely discussed phenomenon. However, business level effects of this phenomenon are by now underresearched. We tackle this research gap by presenting an in-depth analysis of business model changes manufacturing firms employ to adequately react to this technological development. Against the background of a multiple-case study we identify and characterise three archetypes of business models manufacturing firm implement in order to benefit from opportunities provided by the Industrial Internet of Things. Furthermore, we present insights on how firms innovate their extant business model in this context.

abstract={The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) poses large impacts on business models (BM) of established manufacturing companies within several industries. Thus, this paper aims at analyzing the influence of the IIoT on these BMs with particular respect to differences and similarities dependent on varying industry sectors. For this purpose, we employ an exploratory multiple case study approach based on semi-structured expert interviews in 69 manufacturing companies from the five most important German industries. Owing the lack of previous research, our study contributes to the current state of management literature by revealing the following valuable insights with regard to industry-specific BM changes: The machine and plant engineering companies are mainly facing changing workforce qualifications, the electrical engineering and information and communication technology companies are particularly concerned with the importance of novel key partner networks, and automotive suppliers predominantly exploit IIoT-inherent benefits in terms of an increasing cost efficiency. © 2016 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.},

abstract={The variety of products connected to the internet by the Internet of Things (IoT) is rapidly increasing. These products range from industry to consumer products; in fact, a virtual majority of products is expected to become IoT devices in the near future. However, because the information given by these IoT devices is only used by their owners, the term "intranet of things" appears to be more appropriate. For IoT to truly become the Fourth Industrial Revolution, this closed intranet-based architecture has to be changed to an internet-based architecture. EverySense is a new concept IoT market platform that provides end-to-end IoT to improve the business scene of ICT [1]. The EverySense market platform provides a matching mechanism between data provider and data collector with device-independent interoperability. A sharing economy mechanism with high privacy protection is also provided. This paper describes the architecture and concept underlying EverySense and introduces its actual business model. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={Industry 4.0 is a global endeavor of automation and data exchange to create smart factories maximizing production capabilities and allowing for new business models. The Reference Architecture Model for Industry 4.0 (RAMI 4.0) describes the core aspects of Industry 4.0 and defines Administration Shells as digital representations of Industry 4.0 components. In this paper, we present an approach to model and implement Industry 4.0 components with the Resource Description Framework (RDF). The approach addresses the challenges of interoperable communication and machine comprehension in Industry 4.0 settings using semantic technologies. We show how related standards and vocabularies, such as IEC 62264, eCl@ss, and the Ontology of Units of Measure (OM), can be utilized along with the RDF-based representation of the RAMI 4.0 concepts. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability and benefits of the approach using an example from a real-world use case. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={There is a broad consensus that the transformative power of the Internet of Things (IoT) will affect all kinds of industries; or, to put it in a more optimistic light, that almost no domain is excluded from the opportunities to leverage the IoT. But, what does this mean for the future of industrial processes? This article introduces the concept of high-resolution management (HRM). IoT enables the collection of high-resolution data for the physical world where, as in the digital world, every aspect of business operations can be measured in real-time. This capability facilitates high-resolution management, such as short optimization cycles in industrial production, logistics and equipment efficiency, comparable to methods like A/B-Testing or Search Engine Optimization, which are state of the art in digital business. We take the following two perspectives on leveraging high-resolution management. First, through greater insights into their industrial processes, companies that apply HRM in their operations are able to achieve higher efficiency, quality and flexibility. The example of vehicle fleet management illustrates this effect. Second, we build upon the St. Gallen Business Model Navigator in order to look in greater detail on how the IoT affects industrial processes. Gassmann et al.1 introduce 55 generic business model patterns, of which our extended research identified 20 that could profit significantly from the IoT2. Analyzing these 20 patterns allowed for the identification of six key components: Remote Usage and Condition Monitoring, Object Self Service, Digital Addon, Digital Lock-in, Product as a Point of Sales and Physical Freemium. These building blocks help companies to supply HRM-supported offerings. Finally, the example of remote monitoring of process parameters shows that these business model components can also be deployed to create offerings that enable others to apply HRM.},

abstract={The successful initiation and deployment of Smart Grid has stimulated new demands and challenges on the energy supply and distribution side. The emerging new entities participating in electricity, gas and heat network make it an imminent task to recognize and manage them in an integrated fashion, hence rendering Smart Grid gradually evolving towards global energy interconnection (GPEI). In this paper, the novel concept and framework of GPEI are proposed. The integration and interaction on various levels in GPEI are explained and active participants in each layer of GPEI framework are identified. Much like the formation of smart grid and GPEI, the technological concepts of cyber-physical systems, the internet of things (IoT) and the internet of services facilitates the vision of Industry 4.0 which was recently brought forward. Opportunities for business model innovations and added value streams present themselves by opening a dialogue between GEI and Industry 4.0. © 2016, Power System Technology Press.

abstract={Smart devices and cyber-physical systems, which are interconnected to IT systems and services, form the basis for the arising Internet of Everything, opening up new economic opportunities for its participants and users beyond its technological aspects and challenges. While today's e-business scenarios are mostly dominated by a few centralized online platforms, future business models, which will be feasible for the Internet of Everything, need to address special requirements. Such business models, e.g., leveraging the possibilities of smart cities, need to cope with arbitrary combinations of products and services orchestrated into complex products in a highly distributed and dynamic environment. Furthermore, these arbitrary combinations are influenced by real-time context information derived from sensor networks or IT systems, as well as the users' requirements and preferences. The complexity of finding the optimal product/service combination overstrains users and leads to decisions according to the principle of adverse selection (i.e., choosing good enough instead of optimal). Such e-business models require an appropriate underlying value generation architecture that supports users in this process. In this paper, we develop a business model that addresses these problems. In addition, we present the Distributed Market Spaces (DMS) software-system architecture as a possible implementation, which enables the aforementioned decentralized and context-centric e-business scenario and leverages the commercial possibilities of smart cities. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Networked service organisations are increasingly adopting a ‘smarter networking’ philosophy in their design of more agile and customer-focused supply models. Changing consumer behaviours and the emergence of transformative technologies—industry 4.0, artificial intelligence, big data analytics, the Internet of Things—are driving a series of innovations, in terms of ‘products’ and business models, with major implications for the industrial enterprise, in their design of more ‘digitalised’ supply chains. For B2B systems, emerging ‘product-service’ offerings are requiring greater visibility, alignment and integration across an increasingly complex network of multiple partners and collaborators, in order to deliver a better service and customer ‘experience’. To support the design and operation of these multi-organisational service networks, we outline a concept of operations architecture here, underpinned by the literature and network theory, and demonstrate application using a series of exemplar case studies. Focusing on relational elements and the processes key to network integration within service supply networks, the cases inform a set of operating principles and protocols—applicable to all stakeholders ‘cooperating’, within a ‘shared’ environment. Equally critical is to understand how digital technologies may influence future operating philosophies. This article extends our theoretical understanding of network organisations, from a traditional ‘product’ perspective to that of ‘services’, and presents the case for developing a common, unified approach to designing diverse forms of multi-partner service networks. © 2016 The Author(s)},

abstract={The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has gained much attention in practice and research over the last years. It serves as a novel manufacturing paradigm ensuring flexibility and adaptability of production systems and value chains in order to maintain the future global competitiveness of manufacturing enterprises. Its implicated technological change will additionally result in extensive organizational consequences; existing value chains will change resulting in opportunities for new business models (BM). Consequently, established BMs have to be reflected critically. In general, the IIoT constitutes a relatively young research field. While prior literature concentrated on technological aspects, economic has a backlog compared to technical research. Nevertheless, some authors are already dealing with potential influences of the IIoT on BMs in general, but merely focus on specific aspects and have to be regarded in the respective light of their field of research. Thus, there is no comprehensive picture about the impact of the IIoT on established BMs. Hence, this paper addresses this research gap by answering the research question: In what way does academic literature address the impact of the IIoT on BMs of established manufacturers? For this purpose, a systematic literature review is chosen as research method. After a structured selection process with regard to high quality and subject relevance, we eventually identified 87 articles of journals, collected editions, as well as studies of research institutions published between 2011 and 2015, which are analyzed in detail. Subsequently, these were synthesized according to the nine components of the BM Canvas by Osterwalder and Pigneur serving as the analytical framework of this review. Our results show that existing academic literature mainly focuses on IIoT-triggered changes of companieś key resources and activities, whereas particularly the entire customer perspective is mostly disregarded. Furthermore, none of the reviewed scientific works comprehensively deal with the influences of the IIoT on the entire set of BM components at all. Regarding the most prominent qualitative BM changes, we disclose that the IIoT enables an increasing offering of customized, individualized, and smart products and services associated by a consequent service-orientation. For the purpose of the latter, customers are increasingly integrated in development and manufacturing processes on a collaborative basis. In addition, the IIoT-inherent generation of enormous amounts of undirected data, i.e. big data, requires target-oriented data analysis, which then again necessitates specific experts capable of data mining and processing activities. For all the IIoT's intelligent production systems, human beings associated with their keen senses still represent resources of particular importance. Since one of our research goals is to derive need for further research, the review enables us to identify areas to be examined more extensively in future. For instance and among others, we suggest to investigate the customer perspective in more detail as well as to examine the BM as an entire system contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of changes in the context of the IIoT. In conclusion, our paper contributes to a better understanding of IIoT-triggered BM changes, which is not only valuable for academia, but also for enterprises facing the integration of the internet into their value creation processes.},

abstract={Industry is currently undergoing a transformation towards full digitalization and intelligentization of manufacturing processes. Visionary but quite realistic concepts such as the Internet of Things, Industrial Internet, Cloud-based Manufacturing and Smart Manufacturing are drivers of the so called Fourth Industrial Revolution which is commonly referred to as Industry 4.0. Although a common agreement exists on the necessity for technological advancement of production technologies and business models in the sense of Industry 4.0, a major obstacle lies in the perceived complexity and abstractness which partly hinders its quick transformation into industrial practice. To overcome these burdens, we suggest a Scenario-based Industry 4.0 Learning Factory concept that we are currently planning to implement in Austria's first Industry 4.0 Pilot Factory. The concept is built upon a tentative competency model for Industry 4.0 and the use of scenarios for problem-oriented learning of future production engineering. © 2016 The Authors.},

abstract={The fourth industrial revolution and the digital transformation are already major factors in the manufacturing industry and their importance is ever growing. However, the degree of their practical implementation has to be scrutinized. To define a status quo, it is important to analyze the situation and to identify deficits, starting points and unexploited potentials. Still, a detailed understanding of the fourth industrial revolution and the digital transformation is lacking especially in small and medium sized manufacturing companies. In addition, the fourth industrial revolution is associated by most companies only with logistics as well as production and manufacturing areas. The opportunities to integrate additional functional areas of the production process and the vertical value chain into the concept of the fourth industrial revolution are hardly considered. Starting from the point of view that the fourth industrial revolution is defined as a systematic increase in the flexibility of products and processes through automation, extensive networking and decentralized control mechanisms, as well as a data acquisition and integration through information and communication technologies, a study concept is developed. For this purpose, it is not enough to ask only for the present prevalence of technologies of the fourth industrial revolution. It is necessary to analyze the processes within manufacturing companies. A survey concept is developed that initially breaks down the vertical value chain as well as the production process into specific sub-processes. These sub-processes are analyzed regarding their degree of automation and digitalization and networking among themselves. The results of this survey presents concisely the call for action, the state of implementation and realized solutions of the fourth industrial revolution in Germany. Furthermore, impulses and best practices for innovative products and business models can be given. © 2016 The Authors.},

abstract={The various potentials, technologies of the fourth industrial revolution and related disruptive business models enable smart factories in highly efficient production networks. The different influences of the increasing networking for production processes and innovative business models will have a fundamental impact on existing value creation systems. Value creation systems put business models into operation. Certain aspects of these models will be changed more and more quickly and even the business partners will shift. Based on the demands for individual products in batch production, companies are faced with the challenge to create complex and flexible value creations networks. For the implementation of modern value creation structures, comprehensive modifications in the organisational structure are essential. Among adjustments in the internal structure of a company, modifications in the external value creation are also necessary. In the course of the steady rise of information and communication technologies, products get smarter. For companies, this requires new know-how in unknown fields. The paper at hand presents an approach to support companies in designing sustainable value creation structures based on changes of the business models.},

abstract={For a number of years, an increase in manufacturing-related service activities being provided by third parties rather than "in-house" departments has been observed. This trend appears to be strengthening in the context of the Industry 4.0 landscape. The purpose of this paper is to investigate in what sense and at what rate the domain of manufacturing in the UK is transitioning into a major service-oriented field and what types of manufacturing-related activities are most/least suitable for future servitization. Hence, the paper addresses the following questions: i) To what extent has Servitization been adopted in the UK? - What impact is Industry 4.0 currently making? ii) What types of services are currently being offered as a result of industry 4.0? iii) What pros/cons/opportunities/threats does Industry 4.0 bring to British Servitization? - What wider economic issues will make an impact? The research summarized in this paper presents an answer to the outlined questions and draws conclusions as to how this field may further develop in future. The main contributions of this research are the closing of a critical gap in literature by investigating the relationships between the two fields of Servitization and Industry 4.0, and the creation of a framework to allow companies to make themselves aware of Industry 4.0-related services, whilst ensuring these new service innovations are offered in-line with their current business model. © 2016 The Authors.},

abstract={Recently, the German “Industry 4.0” initiative gained momentum, and sketches a vision for future production industries. This chapter reviews industrial challenges in the area of “Industry 4.0”. The findings are structured along the fundamental understanding of production companies as socio-technical systems. Socio-technical systems consist of three important aspects—(i) human, (ii) organizational structures and technology—and, most importantly their mutual relations, and thus, the interdependencies of these aspects. The review reveals that humans need to remain a vital element of future production and need to drive organizational development efforts and continuous workplace improvement. Organizational structures are challenged by changing business models of production companies. Enabling organizational change requires an open organizational culture (e.g., in terms of digital readiness), learning support and digital literacy of all involved stakeholders. In order to create value from Industry 4.0 developments, still technical challenges, in particular vertical and horizontal process integration need be resolved. © The Author(s) 2017.},

abstract={Currently, almost all industries are undergoing a fundamental transformation, based on the approach that everything that can be calculated will be calculated. This more and more leads to a digitalization of the world where software becomes more and more the key success factor also in many brick-and-mortar businesses and change appears more as disruption as evolution. A core concept and business model for the new age is the platform concept. In practice, companies like Airbnb, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Uber are examples of this platform business model. In management theory, the platform model is still in a very early stage of discussion. The chapter will have a deeper look into the concept of platform business models, describing their characteristics and major functional mechanisms. We will also discuss the major differences in comparison to traditional business models and analyze why it is so diffi cult to implement this concept in existing companies. Understanding this gives a good explanation why new players in a market using the platform model have such disruptive effects on the whole industry. Also the paper will explore into the concepts of Internet of Things (IoT) and Industry 4.0 (I4.0). With this understanding, it is possible to have a fi rst glimpse why many traditional industries will be “platformized” in the future and what a suitable lens for a company might be to analyze its position, opportunities, and treats in this new game. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.},

abstract={According to the World Economic Forum, in less than five years from now, over one-third of skills that are considered important in today’s workforce will have changed. By 2020, a Fourth Industrial Revolution is expected to have promoted an exponential pace of change in every aspect of how we live and how we work. In a near future, the increase of digital interconnectivity will promote the emergence of new business models that have no longer to be limited by geographic borders and constraints. This may represent major opportunities as well as interesting challenges to low density and peripheral territories. In the light of the disruptive changes driven by this set of events, it is important to assess current workers’ skills in order to develop dedicated strategies that will foster the envisaged skillset alignment. To this end, a pilot experience was developed in the region of Castelo Branco, classified as a peripheral territory in the Portuguese context. Structured and semi-structured interviews were conducted in diverse industrial and service driven companies in order to assess the local workforce language skills, as well as their intercultural communication abilities. Preliminary findings show that even though labourers are aware of their needs related to the aforementioned communication skills, much work is still needed to promote its widespread increase in local companies. © 2016, Editura Cefin.

abstract={We are rapidly moving into the new era of digitisation, into an era of the Massive Internet of Things - towards the Gigabit Society and towards 5G Technology. The implications are truly far reaching. Rapid transformation through the implementation of INDUSTRY 4.0 is becoming visible in industries all over the world. Disruption to the more traditional industrial practices and processes is inevitable. High Performance Cutting is no exception. Developments in the Internet of Things (IoT) opens up new and extremely powerful capabilities to help us gain a significantly deeper understanding of the fundamentals of cutting processes and offers entirely new connectivity possibilities at all interfaces, some old and some new, "between the Chip Root and the Cloud". This supports us in our attempts since the foundation of CIRP in 1951 to remove technological roadblocks and can lead on a new journey towards new and unprecedented scientific/technological developments as well as new business models for companies involved in the various elements of the supply chain for cutting processes (DIN 8580). "Performance" will take on a new and unanticipated meaning over what was originally meant when we established this CIRP-HPC Conference back in the early 2000's. In this paper a critical review of a previous roadmap is undertaken for cutting processes presented in a CIRP Keynote Paper in 2003 by Byrne, Dornfeld and Denkena [1] and new thoughts and ideas are presented on a vision for a 2020 skeleton Roadmap for High Performance Cutting in the new age of Digitisation.},

abstract={Today's mankind and all human activities are constantly changing and evolving in response to changes in technology, social and economic environments and climate. Those changes drive a "new" way of manufacturing industry. That novelty could be described as the organization of production processes based on technology and devices autonomously communicating with each other along the value chain. Decision-makers have to address this novelty (usually named as Industry 4.0) and try to develop appropriate information systems, physical facilities, and different kind of technologies capable of meeting the future needs of economy. As a consequence, there is a need for new paradigms of the way freight is move, store, realize, and supply through the world (logistics system). One of the proposed solutions is the Physical Internet, concept of open global logistics system which completely redefines current supply chain configuration, business models, and value-creation patterns.However, further detailed research on this topic is much needed. This paper aims to provide a balanced review of the variety of views considered among professionals in the field of Physical Internet with the final aim to identify the biggest challenges (technological, societal, business paradigm) of proposed new logistics paradigm as a practical solution in supporting Industry 4.0. © 2016 M.

abstract={Evolving business needs and shorter product life cycle demand for new methods and services from production facilities. In the past few decades, research and technology has been advanced at the rapid pace on enterprise level. Technology used at production level is still quite old and has not gained much attention in comparison to enterprise level. Enterprises are interested to invest more resources on production level to overcome problems and satisfy goals of stakeholders. The paper discuss the termIndustry 4.0 and whywe need changes in our traditional manufacturing systems (due to new business models, companies’ competition, and innovation gap). We find-out what are the current challenges faced by organizations with the help of a survey. We also list new opportunities and applications possible by introducing new tools and technologies and provide initial feedback of a scenario from case company. At the end, we discuss how to solve these challenges, scenarios and summarize our paper. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

abstract={The term "Industrie 4.0" denotes the advent of the fourth industrial revolution which will be characterized by the optimized and networked use of information across the complete life cycles of both products and production assets. The exploitation of Industrie 4.0 paradigms in terms of economic benefit, flexibility and better-informed decision taking requires the availability and provision of adequate information across all engineering and production value chains in an interoperable way, preferably based upon international standards. Up to now, a hierarchical structure of information technology (IT) systems, the so-called automation pyramid, is predominant in industrial production environments. This leads to a separation of office and production networks that shield the safety- and real-time critical field and controller level from inadequate access from upper levels and remote users. Now, with the application of the paradigms of the Internet of Things and Services (IoTS), there is an architectural trend towards a mash-up of networked smart devices and services, deployed within and across enterprises in order to enable new higher-level services and business models such as smart maintenance. This contribution considers this architectural IT paradigm shift from a risk management perspective. © 2016 CURRAN-CONFERENCE. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In recent years, digital transformation has been heralded as a strategic concept for companies of all sectors. The Internet of Things could be seen as representing the most tangible form of digital transformation because it refers to the digitalization of end products and services geared toward customers. The insertion of an ever-increasing amount of software into physical products and the associated integration of intelligence into machines and systems has led to the gradual conversion of production-oriented added value into service-oriented added value. In the medium term-provided it is implemented systematically-Industry 4.0 will have a far more profound influence on corporate business models and processes than the aspect primarily associated with digital transformation up to now, namely the customer experience/customer relation factor. The increasing “intelligence” in manufacturing plants, the consistent incorporation of local intelligence such as sensors and embedded software into the production process and logistics chain and the resulting information management opportunities facilitate different decision-making paths and reactions that will bring massive changes to the entire process of work in manufacturing companies and to the direct environment of individual workers. Furthermore, the fact that the manufactured products also increasingly contain local intelligence and communication technology completes the cycle leading to another altered form of customer experience. Today, even after delivery to the customer, manufactured goods maintain contact with the manufacturer. This promises enormous added value potential for the manufacturing industry. But this development also bears a great responsibility for corporate management to successfully manage this process of change. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2017.},

abstract={The range of digital disruption is far broader and deeper than any one volume can cover. For example, some of the industries that need further discussions are robotics, artifi cial intelligence, digital platforms and the role that information management plays in the next wave of business models. The purpose of this book has been to view the impacts of digital technology on a selected group of industries and to provide some guiding frameworks to view potential impacts to allow business leaders to identify and start to deal with the effects of digital disruption. This last chapter does not provide a single narrative summary of the topics covered in this book. It is more a thematic review of the ideas raised combined with an identifi cation of other aspects of digital disruption not directly treated. These include the risks of digital technologies and the enabling capabilities of big data and advanced analytics and the Internet of things. Our intention is to provide brief vignettes of these areas to inform the reader of additional lines of enquiry. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.},

abstract={Although 3D printing has attracted remarkable attention from both industry and academia society, still only a relatively small number of people have access to required 3D printers and know how to use them. One of the challenges is that how to fill the gap between the unbalanced supply of various 3D printing capabilities and the customized demands from geographically distributed customers. The integration of 3D printing into cloud manufacturing may promote the development of future smart networks of virtual 3D printing cloud, and allow a new serviceoriented 3D printing business model to achieve mass customization. This paper presents a primary 3D printing cloud model and an advanced 3D printing cloud model, and analyzes the 3D printing service delivery paradigms in the models. Further, the paper proposes a 3D printing cloud platform architecture design to support the advanced model. The proposed advanced 3D printing cloud model as well as the architecture design can provide a reference for the development of various 3D printing clouds. Copyright © 2016 by ASME.},

abstract={The development of industrialization and information communication technology (ICT) has deeply changed our way of life. In particular, with the emerging theory of "Industry 4.0", the integration of cloud technologies and industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPS) becomes increasingly important, as this will greatly improve the manufacturing chain and business services. In this paper, we first describe the development and character of ICPS. ICPS will inevitably play an important role in manufacturing, sales, and logistics. With the support of the cloud, ICPS development will impact value creation, business models, downstream services, and work organization. Then, we present a service-oriented ICPS model. With the support of the cloud, infrastructure platform and service application, ICPS will promote the manufacturing efficiency, increase quality of production, enable a sustainable industrial system and more environmentally friendly businesses. Thirdly, we focus on some key enabling technologies, which are critical in supporting smart factories. These key enabling technologies will also help companies to realize high quality, high output, and low cost. Finally, we talk about some challenges of ICPS implementation and the future work. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The transition from product-centric to service-centric business models presents a major challenge to industrial automation and manufacturing systems. This transition increases Machine-to-Machine connectivity among industrial devices, industrial controls systems, and factory floor devices. While initiatives like Industry 4.0 or the Industrial Internet Consortium motivate this transition, the emergence of the Internet of Things and Cyber Physical Systems are key enablers. However, automated and autonomous processes require trust in the communication entities and transferred data. Therefore, we study how to secure a smart service use case for industrial maintenance scenarios. In this use case, equipment needs to securely transmit its status information to local and remote recipients. We investigate and compare two security technologies that provide isolation and a secured execution environment: ARM TrustZone and a Security Controller. To compare these technologies we design and implement a device snapshot authentication system. Our results indicate that the TrustZone based approach promises greater flexibility and performance, but only the Security Controller strongly protects against physical attacks. We argue that the best technology actually depends on the use case and propose a hybrid approach that maximizes security for high-security industrial applications. We believe that the insights we gained will help introducing advanced security mechanisms into the future Industrial Internet of Things. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Today, embedded, mobile, and cyberphysical systems are ubiquitous and used in many applications, from industrial control systems, modern vehicles, to critical infrastructure. Current trends and initiatives, such as 'Industrie 4.0' and Internet of Things (IoT), promise innovative business models and novel user experiences through strong connectivity and effective use of next generation of embedded devices. These systems generate, process, and exchange vast amounts of security-critical and privacy-sensitive data, which makes them attractive targets of attacks. Cyberattacks on IoT systems are very critical since they may cause physical damage and even threaten human lives. The complexity of these systems and the potential impact of cyberattacks bring upon new threats. This paper gives an introduction to Industrial IoT systems, the related security and privacy challenges, and an outlook on possible solutions towards a holistic security framework for Industrial IoT systems. © 2015 ACM.},

abstract={The research area of Industry 4.0 or Industrial Internet offers great potential, ranging from the optimization of a company's own value creation to new business models. The latter have rarely been specified. The systematic integration of Industry 4.0 aspects into the business model context has only just begun.

abstract={EU industry accounts for 15% of European value added and the industrial sector plays the role of a key driver for research, innovation, productivity, job creation and exports. One important measure in order to stop the decline of Europe's global industrial position is represented by Industry 4.0 aiming for the implementation of smart production and logistics. Industry 4.0 touches the entire supply chain comprising product design and development, operations management and logistics and by doing so new business models and structures are required. Currently, companies start to practice first steps in 3D printing, production in networks and smart logistics and begin to develop new organisational structures and business models to benefit more from the opportunities that the new technology offers. Empirical evidences of successful companies reveals that the new business models are oriented rather on service design, open innovation and network approaches than on the traditional concepts of industrial enterprises. Consequently, traditional industrial companies have to rethink and to renew their business structures and models in parallel with the ongoing implementation of Industry 4.0 to use the new opportunities. The main focus of Industry 4.0 is laid on the fusion of the virtual and the physical world so that also new concepts are required for managing information and business administration tasks in the context of Industry 4.0. One big step towards the implementation of such a concept is embodied by the Estonian concept of "e-Residency", which might be an appropriate e-business approach especially when taking into account the needs of internationally operating entrepreneurs and SME's. The paper addresses the research question of how new and sustainable business models and structures for Industry 4.0 might look like and in which direction existing traditional business concepts have to be developed to deploy a strong business impact of Industry 4.0. By focussing on the needs of entrepreneurs and SME sector the paper also discusses why e-residency might be the appropriate concept in the context of Industry 4.0.},

abstract={Volatile markets and global and inter-industrial networks are creating a radically more dynamic market environment which calls for considerably greater on-demand flexibility in resource deployment. Today's businesses have to respond to evolving trends. As well as increasing flexibility, this also means taking action in two further areas, namely increasing transformability and responding to demographic change. Furthermore the global change towards a fully networked society is in progress, in Germany, in Europe, and of course in the United States – actually more or less all over the world. In this context one significant topic is the “Internet of things and services”. The digital transformation changes business and private life likewise – in a radically and sustainable way. The economic potential is enormous. Topics related to the networking of the internet by far have the most economical potential worldwide. The world becomes more and more digital. This is the Big Business of the future. Digitally networked and data-intensive are the main attributes of a smarter production, the so called industry 4.0. But not only in technology many things are changing, humans and the society transforms, too. To achieve a positive influence on key performance indicators, organizational approaches to enterprise architecture should not be restricted to purely technical aspects but should instead put the focus firmly on employees. The study examines initial design approaches in the areas of qualifications, leadership and demography-resistant work architectures. © 2015 The Authors},

abstract={Many companies in the German mechanical engineering and related industries need to transform from a product manufacturer to a problem solver. Against the background of Industry 4.0 the discussion is more and more about new business models. The main success potential for companies lays in the early and integrative development of product concept, production system concept and a promising business model. The paper at hands discusses business models within the product engineering process and success factors. Furthermore an approach is introduced towards a discursive business model development. Finally the possibilities of business model patterns are discussed. © 2014, Carl Hanser Verlag, München.},

abstract={We are currently experiencing the fourth Industrial Revolution in terms of cyber physical systems. These systems are industrial automation systems that enable many innovative functionalities through their networking and their access to the cyber world, thus changing our everyday lives significantly. In this context, new business models, work processes and development methods that are currently unimaginable will arise. These changes will also strongly influence the society and people. Family life, globalization, markets, etc. will have to be redefined. However, the Industry 4.0 simultaneously shows characteristics that represent the challenges regarding the development of cyber-physical systems, reliability, security and data protection. Following a brief introduction to Industry 4.0, this paper presents a prototypical application that demonstrates the essential aspects. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={This book documents the scientific results of the projects related to the Trusted Cloud Program, covering fundamental aspects of trust, security, and quality of service for cloud-based services and applications. These results aim to allow trustworthy IT applications in the cloud by providing a reliable and secure technical and legal framework. In this domain, business models, legislative circumstances, technical possibilities, and realizable security are closely interwoven and thus are addressed jointly. The book is organized in four parts on �Security and Privacy�, �Software Engineering and Software Quality�, �Platforms, Middleware and Integration�, and �Social Aspects, Business Models and Standards�. It thus provides a holistic view on technological, societal, and legal aspects, which are indispensable not only to ensure the security of cloud services and the data they process, but also to gain the trust of society, business, industry, and science in these services. The ultimate goal of the book, as well as of the Trusted Cloud Program in general, is to distribute these results to a broader audience in both academia and industry, and thus to help with the proliferation of "Industry 4.0" services. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},
