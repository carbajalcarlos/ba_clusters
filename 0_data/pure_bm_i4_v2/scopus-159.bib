abstract={We are currently experiencing the fourth Industrial Revolution in terms of cyber physical systems. These systems are industrial automation systems that enable many innovative functionalities through their networking and their access to the cyber world, thus changing our everyday lives significantly. In this context, new business models, work processes and development methods that are currently unimaginable will arise. These changes will also strongly influence the society and people. Family life, globalization, markets, etc. will have to be redefined. However, the Industry 4.0 simultaneously shows characteristics that represent the challenges regarding the development of cyber-physical systems, reliability, security and data protection. Following a brief introduction to Industry 4.0, this paper presents a prototypical application that demonstrates the essential aspects. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Industry is currently undergoing a transformation towards full digitalization and intelligentization of manufacturing processes. Visionary but quite realistic concepts such as the Internet of Things, Industrial Internet, Cloud-based Manufacturing and Smart Manufacturing are drivers of the so called Fourth Industrial Revolution which is commonly referred to as Industry 4.0. Although a common agreement exists on the necessity for technological advancement of production technologies and business models in the sense of Industry 4.0, a major obstacle lies in the perceived complexity and abstractness which partly hinders its quick transformation into industrial practice. To overcome these burdens, we suggest a Scenario-based Industry 4.0 Learning Factory concept that we are currently planning to implement in Austria's first Industry 4.0 Pilot Factory. The concept is built upon a tentative competency model for Industry 4.0 and the use of scenarios for problem-oriented learning of future production engineering. © 2016 The Authors.},

abstract={The development of industrialization and information communication technology (ICT) has deeply changed our way of life. In particular, with the emerging theory of "Industry 4.0", the integration of cloud technologies and industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPS) becomes increasingly important, as this will greatly improve the manufacturing chain and business services. In this paper, we first describe the development and character of ICPS. ICPS will inevitably play an important role in manufacturing, sales, and logistics. With the support of the cloud, ICPS development will impact value creation, business models, downstream services, and work organization. Then, we present a service-oriented ICPS model. With the support of the cloud, infrastructure platform and service application, ICPS will promote the manufacturing efficiency, increase quality of production, enable a sustainable industrial system and more environmentally friendly businesses. Thirdly, we focus on some key enabling technologies, which are critical in supporting smart factories. These key enabling technologies will also help companies to realize high quality, high output, and low cost. Finally, we talk about some challenges of ICPS implementation and the future work. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Design for sustainable manufacturing enterprise (DFSME) is considered to be a new ideologue regarding survival of manufacturing enterprise and it can also be considered as one of the most important solutions to deal with the existing global financial crisis. The DFSME is a systemic approach that simultaneously determines the aspects of sustainability and how they can be aggregated taking into consideration the globalisation issues. The problem addressed in this paper is how to present the concepts of sustainability to guide manufacturing enterprises analysts and designers with the most effective aspects for analysing sustainability. These aspects are: international issues; contemporary issues; innovative products; reconfigurable manufacturing systems; manufacturing strategies; business models; flexible organisation management; manufacturing strategies and performance measurements. Based on these aspects, the sustainable model will be analysed and presented through covering all aspects of sustainable manufacturing enterprise and the sustainability assessment will be measured. The ultimate goal of this paper is to consider the needs of manufacturing enterprise throughout most of the world to be sustainable as well as to be globalised enterprises. This analysis shows that the DFSME is a very large task and should be taken into consideration as one aspect of the next industrial revolution. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={The article analyzes how Industry 4.0 triggers changes in the business models of manufacturing SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises), by conducting a qualitative research with a sample of 68 German SMEs from three industries (automotive suppliers, mechanical and plant engineering, as well as electrical engineering and ICT). As SMEs play an essential role in industrial value creation, the article examines significant, yet at present understudied implications of Industry 4.0 along industrial value chains. First, the results show that Industry 4.0 encompasses three dimensions, namely high-grade digitization of processes, smart manufacturing, and inter-company connectivity. Second, the article shows how Industry 4.0 affects the three business model elements of manufacturing SMEs – value creation, value capture, and value offer – by giving specific examples for business model innovation in each of the three elements. Third, it shows that both the role as a user and/or provider of Industry 4.0 and whether a company is internally motivated and/or externally pressured towards implementation have an impact on which business model elements are innovated. Fourth, the study delineates four SME categories, designed to help managers to evaluate their own company's positioning towards Industry 4.0: craft manufacturers, preliminary stage planners, Industry 4.0 users, and full-scale adopters.

abstract={Volatile markets and global and inter-industrial networks are creating a radically more dynamic market environment which calls for considerably greater on-demand flexibility in resource deployment. Today's businesses have to respond to evolving trends. As well as increasing flexibility, this also means taking action in two further areas, namely increasing transformability and responding to demographic change. Furthermore the global change towards a fully networked society is in progress, in Germany, in Europe, and of course in the United States – actually more or less all over the world. In this context one significant topic is the “Internet of things and services”. The digital transformation changes business and private life likewise – in a radically and sustainable way. The economic potential is enormous. Topics related to the networking of the internet by far have the most economical potential worldwide. The world becomes more and more digital. This is the Big Business of the future. Digitally networked and data-intensive are the main attributes of a smarter production, the so called industry 4.0. But not only in technology many things are changing, humans and the society transforms, too. To achieve a positive influence on key performance indicators, organizational approaches to enterprise architecture should not be restricted to purely technical aspects but should instead put the focus firmly on employees. The study examines initial design approaches in the areas of qualifications, leadership and demography-resistant work architectures. © 2015 The Authors},

abstract={Evolving business needs and shorter product life cycle demand for new methods and services from production facilities. In the past few decades, research and technology has been advanced at the rapid pace on enterprise level. Technology used at production level is still quite old and has not gained much attention in comparison to enterprise level. Enterprises are interested to invest more resources on production level to overcome problems and satisfy goals of stakeholders. The paper discuss the termIndustry 4.0 and whywe need changes in our traditional manufacturing systems (due to new business models, companies’ competition, and innovation gap). We find-out what are the current challenges faced by organizations with the help of a survey.

abstract={EU industry accounts for 15% of European value added and the industrial sector plays the role of a key driver for research, innovation, productivity, job creation and exports. One important measure in order to stop the decline of Europe's global industrial position is represented by Industry 4.0 aiming for the implementation of smart production and logistics. Industry 4.0 touches the entire supply chain comprising product design and development, operations management and logistics and by doing so new business models and structures are required. Currently, companies start to practice first steps in 3D printing, production in networks and smart logistics and begin to develop new organisational structures and business models to benefit more from the opportunities that the new technology offers. Empirical evidences of successful companies reveals that the new business models are oriented rather on service design, open innovation and network approaches than on the traditional concepts of industrial enterprises. Consequently, traditional industrial companies have to rethink and to renew their business structures and models in parallel with the ongoing implementation of Industry 4.0 to use the new opportunities. The main focus of Industry 4.0 is laid on the fusion of the virtual and the physical world so that also new concepts are required for managing information and business administration tasks in the context of Industry 4.0. One big step towards the implementation of such a concept is embodied by the Estonian concept of "e-Residency", which might be an appropriate e-business approach especially when taking into account the needs of internationally operating entrepreneurs and SME's. The paper addresses the research question of how new and sustainable business models and structures for Industry 4.0 might look like and in which direction existing traditional business concepts have to be developed to deploy a strong business impact of Industry 4.0. By focussing on the needs of entrepreneurs and SME sector the paper also discusses why e-residency might be the appropriate concept in the context of Industry 4.0.},

abstract={Re-industrialization enjoys a renaissance in Western economies due to the role of the industrial sector for innovation, productivity, and job creation. A very promising approach to bring back competitiveness in production seems to be the fusion of the virtual and the real world leading to smart manufacturing and logistics concepts. In Germany, the leading industrial country in the European Union this approach has been called “Industry 4.0” aiming to develop cyber-physical systems (CPS) and dynamic production networks in order to achieve flexible and open value chains in manufacturing of complex mass customization products in small series. Currently, manufacturing companies gaining experiences in production in networks and smart logistics and develop new organisational structures and business models which better benefit from the new technologies and which adapt faster to the rapidly changing network environments. The modern manufacturing models embrace modular and fractal approaches as well as network-orientation, flexibility and responsiveness. The paper investigates the relationship between networking, organizational development, structural frame conditions and sustainability in the context of Industry 4.0. The research is empirically validated by using data samples from a business reengineering project in an internationally operating high-tech manufacturing enterprise located in Estonia. The empiric analysis is based on semi-structured expert interviews and secondary data together with a case study approach. © 2017 by author(s) and VsI Entrepreneurship and Sustainability Center.},

abstract={Industry 4.0 provides new paradigms for the industrial management of SMEs. Supported by a growing number of new technologies, this concept appears more flexible and less expensive than traditional enterprise information systems such as ERP and MES. However, SMEs find themselves ill-equipped to face these new possibilities regarding their production planning and control functions. This paper presents a literature review of existing applied research covering different Industry 4.0 issues with regard to SMEs. Papers are classified according to a new framework which allows identification of the targeted performance objectives, the required managerial capacities and the selected group of technologies for each selected case. Our results show that SMEs do not exploit all the resources for implementing Industry 4.0 and often limit themselves to the adoption of Cloud Computing and the Internet of Things. Likewise, SMEs seem to have adopted Industry 4.0 concepts only for monitoring industrial processes and there is still absence of real applications in the field of production planning. Finally, our literature review shows that reported Industry 4.0 projects in SMEs remained cost-driven initiatives and there in still no evidence of real business model transformation at this time. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={The global industrial landscape has changed deeply in the last few years due to successive technological developments and innovations in manufacturing processes. The Industry 4.0 concept has emerged and the academic literature has paid an increased attention to this topic, which remains non-consensual or ill defined. In this research, a literature review is made to understand this concept in its technological dimension, and to comprehend its impacts. This new industrial paradigm brings together the digital and physical worlds through the Cyber-Physical Systems enhanced by Internet of Things and it is expected that this novel has consequences on industry, markets and economy, improving production processes and increasing productivity, affecting the whole product lifecycle, creating new business models, changing the work environment and restructuring the labor market. Therefore, this paper focuses on Industry 4.0 concept and contributes for its clarification and further understanding about the importance and implications of this complex technological system. © 2017 The Author(s)},

abstract={According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), broadband access networks enable the emergence of new business models, processes, inventions, as well as improved goods and services. In fact, broadband access is viewed as a so-called general purpose technology (GPT) that has the potential to fundamentally change how and where economic activity is organized. In this paper, we focus on the implications of the emerging Third Industrial Revolution (TIR) economy, which goes well beyond current austerity measures, and has recently been officially endorsed by the European Commission as the economic growth roadmap toward a competitive low carbon society by 2050. This roadmap has been receiving an increasing amount of attention by other key players, e.g., the Government of China most recently. More specifically, we describe a variety of advanced techniques to render converged bimodal fiber-wireless (FiWi) broadband access networks dependable, including optical coding based fiber fault monitoring techniques, localized optical redundancy strategies, wireless extensions, and availability-aware routing algorithms, to improve their reliability, availability, survivability, security, and safety. Next, we elaborate on how the resultant dependent FiWi access networks can be exploited to enhance the dependability of other critical infrastructures of our society, most notably the future smart power grid and its envisioned electric transportation, by means of probabilistic analysis, co-simulation, and experimental demonstration. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={This work makes a case for the integration of the increasingly popular and largely separate topics of Industry 4.0 and the circular economy (CE). The paper extends the state-of-the-art literature by proposing a pioneering roadmap to enhance the application of CE principles in organisations by means of Industry 4.0 approaches. Advanced and digital manufacturing technologies are able to unlock the circularity of resources within supply chains; however, the connection between CE and Industry 4.0 has not so far been explored. This article therefore contributes to the literature by unveiling how different Industry 4.0 technologies could underpin CE strategies, and to organisations by addressing those technologies as a basis for sustainable operations management decision-making. The main results of this work are: (a) a discussion on the mutually beneficial relationship between Industry 4.0 and the CE; (b) an in-depth understanding of the potential contributions of smart production technologies to the ReSOLVE model of CE business models; (c) a research agenda for future studies on the integration between Industry 4.0 and CE principles based on the most relevant management theories. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The objectives of this paper are (1) to have a detailed, practical discussion of Industry 4.0, and (2) to suggest policy implications to transition toward Industry 4.0 in Korea. Companies should consider Industry 4.0 very seriously as they develop their future initiatives since traditional manufacturing business models do not fit with the emerging technologies of Industry 4.0. Some issues should be addressed with care: IT security, reliability and stability needed for critical machine-to-machine communication; a need to maintain the integrity of production processes, avoid IT snags, and protect industrial knowhow; and the lack of adequate skill-sets, general reluctance to change by stakeholders, and loss of many jobs to automatic processes and IT-controlled processes. To successfully transform Korean industry toward Industry 4.0, it is necessary to (1) refine and elaborate the strategies enacted by the central government to build economic and social systems that can flexibly respond to changes, (2) establish some kind of operational system to maximize the effectiveness of initiatives and policies, (3) develop concrete and workable action plans to transition toward economic and social systems that can accommodate innovative changes, and (4) establish infrastructure to lead all initiatives. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={For a number of years, an increase in manufacturing-related service activities being provided by third parties rather than "in-house" departments has been observed. This trend appears to be strengthening in the context of the Industry 4.0 landscape. The purpose of this paper is to investigate in what sense and at what rate the domain of manufacturing in the UK is transitioning into a major service-oriented field and what types of manufacturing-related activities are most/least suitable for future servitization. Hence, the paper addresses the following questions: i) To what extent has Servitization been adopted in the UK? - What impact is Industry 4.0 currently making? ii) What types of services are currently being offered as a result of industry 4.0? iii) What pros/cons/opportunities/threats does Industry 4.0 bring to British Servitization? - What wider economic issues will make an impact? The research summarized in this paper presents an answer to the outlined questions and draws conclusions as to how this field may further develop in future. The main contributions of this research are the closing of a critical gap in literature by investigating the relationships between the two fields of Servitization and Industry 4.0, and the creation of a framework to allow companies to make themselves aware of Industry 4.0-related services, whilst ensuring these new service innovations are offered in-line with their current business model. © 2016 The Authors.},

abstract={The evolution of markets and customer requirements with highest level of precision, has been achieved created with technology and information systems, a new way of make the operations in the companies, and just the companies with the ability to adapt faster to technological innovations may remain on the market. The last industrial revolution, known as industry 4.0 perceives the operations as a holistic system, its represents a challenge that must be fulfilled and faced in order to achieve stability and permanence in the market, from the point of view of the world economies. In the organizational and business area all the operations must be linked to computer systems and management of information in the network, which causes greater efficiency in the flow. With this new perception of industry and the business, it involves different analytical tools that aim at bigger efficiency in the service to the consumers, resulting in a greater competitiveness in the market and making the differentiator. This work is one of the first surveys that provides an extensive analysis and review of 110 publications that appear from 1/01/12 to 20/02/17. The purpose of the study is to analyze categorically recent advances through qualitative and segmentation methods allowing to reveal trends and areas of opportunity in the industry sense of 4.0 in order to obtain research gaps that may be executed in organizational systems on the value chain. Another point is to be a reference in future research related to the categories selected in this study. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.},

abstract={The concept of Industry 4.0 is a new reality of the modern economy, because innovation and technological development play an important role in each organization. Industry 4.0 significantly changes products and production systems concerning the design, processes, operations and services. Certainly, the implementation of this concept has further consequences for management and future jobs through creating new business models. The objective of the present paper is to present the attitude of entrepreneurs to Industry 4.0, to indicate readiness for implementing the elements of the concept and to point out the barriers, which may possibly threaten enterprises in the effective achievement of a higher technological and organizational level. The research conducted in the paper is based on secondary data, obtained from many professional reports and studies, carried out by State institutions, consortia or enterprises. The international analyses coming from those documents show a significant interest in challenges imposed on companies by the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The majority of the respondents recognize the concept of Industry 4.0 as a great opportunity for development and improvement in competitiveness, although the state of preparations for its implementation varies widely depending on country, sector, or even an individual company. © 2018, Czestochowa University of Technology.

abstract={In the Industry 4.0 world that is digitalizing and automating, sustainable business models exist but have not become mainstream. Opportunities for sustainable offerings exist by designing products for longevity, repair and recycling, such that sustainability is not only focusing on being more efficient, but also on using less raw materials and recycling more products. This changes the value proposition, supply chain, relation with the customer and financial justification of a business model. This paper discusses potential sustainable business scenarios, and proposes an agenda for research into how Industry 4.0 can be used to create sustainable business models. © 2017 The Authors.

abstract={“Big data”—the collection of vast quantities of data about individual behavior via online, mobile, and other data-driven services—has been heralded as the agent of a third industrial revolution—one with raw materials measured in bits, rather than tons of steel or barrels of oil. Yet the industrial revolution transformed not just how firms made things, but the fundamental approach to value creation in industrial economies. To date, big data has not achieved this distinction. Instead, today’s successful big data business models largely use data to scale old modes of value creation, rather than invent new ones altogether. Moreover, today’s big data cannot deliver the promised revolution. In this way, today’s big data landscape resembles the early phases of the first industrial revolution, rather than the culmination of the second a century later. Realizing the second big data revolution will require fundamentally different kinds of data, different innovations, and different business models than those seen to date. That fact has profound consequences for the kinds of investments and innovations firms must seek, and the economic, political, and social consequences that those innovations portend. © The Author(s) 2015.},

abstract={Grinding is often the final step in the process/manufacturing chain, meaning that no subsequent post-grinding correction of the surface and geometry is performed. This imposes strong requirements on grinding-machine technology and on the understanding of this finalising process. While grinding has unique capabilities it is nevertheless in competition with other machining processes. The evolution of grinding machines is driven by process requirements like accuracy, MRR, and subsurface integrity. The regeneration of the tool on the machine with dressing devices is to be regarded as unique for grinding machines, hence a grinding machine always runs two separate processes. The high accuracy of grinding has, in fact, been an obstacle to simply adopting developments from other machining processes. Also, a lack of experienced machinists and a general trend towards individualized products and one-piece flow has required a transition from an experience-based approach to a science-based approach. Development is further driven by market demands, such as cost-reduction in terms of CAPEX, footprint, TCO versus quality, and throughput, which affect business models and the machine's design and construction. Moreover, the current mega-trends – such as resource efficiency, individualization, ergonomics and Industry 4.0 – are changing the appearance of grinding machines, which is also affected by the availability of new technologies, especially sensors, actuators and the control or machine intelligence. This paper reviews the most-relevant technologies, assesses their impact and the readiness of industry to adopt them, identifies the still-open issues, and concludes with future research requirements. © 2017},

abstract={Industry 4.0 is a global endeavor of automation and data exchange to create smart factories maximizing production capabilities and allowing for new business models. The Reference Architecture Model for Industry 4.0 (RAMI 4.0) describes the core aspects of Industry 4.0 and defines Administration Shells as digital representations of Industry 4.0 components. In this paper, we present an approach to model and implement Industry 4.0 components with the Resource Description Framework (RDF). The approach addresses the challenges of interoperable communication and machine comprehension in Industry 4.0 settings using semantic technologies. We show how related standards and vocabularies, such as IEC 62264, eCl@ss, and the Ontology of Units of Measure (OM), can be utilized along with the RDF-based representation of the RAMI 4.0 concepts. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability and benefits of the approach using an example from a real-world use case. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Recent studies advocate that digital technologies are key enabling factors for the introduction of servitized business models. At the same time, these technologies support the implementation of the circular economy (CE) paradigm into businesses. Despite this general agreement, the literature still overlooks how digital technologies enable such a CE transition. To fill the gap, this paper develops a conceptual framework, based on the literature and a case study of a company implementing a usage-focused servitized business model in the household appliance industry. This study focuses on the Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data, and analytics, and identifies eight specific functionalities enabled by such technologies (improving product design, attracting target customers, monitoring and tracking product activity, providing technical support, providing preventive and predictive maintenance, optimizing the product usage, upgrading the product, enhancing renovation and end-of-life activities). By investigating how these functionalities affect three CE value drivers (increasing resource efficiency, extending lifespan, and closing the loop), the conceptual framework developed in this paper advances knowledge about the role of digital technologies as an enabler of the CE within usage-focused business models. Finally, this study shows how digital technologies help overcome the drawback of usage-focused business models for the adoption of CE pointed out by previous literature. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={The transition from product-centric to service-centric business models presents a major challenge to industrial automation and manufacturing systems. This transition increases Machine-to-Machine connectivity among industrial devices, industrial controls systems, and factory floor devices. While initiatives like Industry 4.0 or the Industrial Internet Consortium motivate this transition, the emergence of the Internet of Things and Cyber Physical Systems are key enablers. However, automated and autonomous processes require trust in the communication entities and transferred data. Therefore, we study how to secure a smart service use case for industrial maintenance scenarios. In this use case, equipment needs to securely transmit its status information to local and remote recipients. We investigate and compare two security technologies that provide isolation and a secured execution environment: ARM TrustZone and a Security Controller. To compare these technologies we design and implement a device snapshot authentication system. Our results indicate that the TrustZone based approach promises greater flexibility and performance, but only the Security Controller strongly protects against physical attacks. We argue that the best technology actually depends on the use case and propose a hybrid approach that maximizes security for high-security industrial applications. We believe that the insights we gained will help introducing advanced security mechanisms into the future Industrial Internet of Things. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Industry 4.0 is very popular topic today because of its big influence on manufacturing. Industry 4.0 is focused on creating "smart" environment within production system. Several priority areas of action, in order to get closer to the state of Industry 4.0. are shown. There are also the most important changes, that will occur in the manufacturing operations and information technology. Some leading manufacturers of technology for Industry 4.0 are presented. Many papers explore new business concepts and strategies for adaption to new industrial revolution. This paper provides an overview of several concepts and strategies. Different strategies and concepts selected from literature are compared in order to detect the areas that are not covered.},

abstract={We are rapidly moving into the new era of digitisation, into an era of the Massive Internet of Things - towards the Gigabit Society and towards 5G Technology. The implications are truly far reaching. Rapid transformation through the implementation of INDUSTRY 4.0 is becoming visible in industries all over the world. Disruption to the more traditional industrial practices and processes is inevitable. High Performance Cutting is no exception. Developments in the Internet of Things (IoT) opens up new and extremely powerful capabilities to help us gain a significantly deeper understanding of the fundamentals of cutting processes and offers entirely new connectivity possibilities at all interfaces, some old and some new, "between the Chip Root and the Cloud". This supports us in our attempts since the foundation of CIRP in 1951 to remove technological roadblocks and can lead on a new journey towards new and unprecedented scientific/technological developments as well as new business models for companies involved in the various elements of the supply chain for cutting processes (DIN 8580). "Performance" will take on a new and unanticipated meaning over what was originally meant when we established this CIRP-HPC Conference back in the early 2000's. In this paper a critical review of a previous roadmap is undertaken for cutting processes presented in a CIRP Keynote Paper in 2003 by Byrne, Dornfeld and Denkena [1] and new thoughts and ideas are presented on a vision for a 2020 skeleton Roadmap for High Performance Cutting in the new age of Digitisation.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is now making a new industrial revolution, which includes 'Industrie4.0' in Germany, 'Industrial Internet' in US, 'Made in China 2025' in China, and the 'Industrial Value Chain Initiative (IVI)' in Japan. In the modern global, competitive, and collaborative business environment, IoT services must be designed as a business ecosystem. Although many business-model design methods, including our own design method presented in PICMET2015, have been proposed, there exist few business-ecosystem design methods that target IoT services especially. Here, a business-ecosystem design method is proposed for IoT services using an 'Open & Closed Strategy Canvas,' on which designers can recognize both a closed area where the company keeps and strengthens their core competence, and an open area, where complementary companies provide resources (knowledge resource, manufacturing resource, and deployment resource) to the business ecosystem. © 2016 Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology, Inc.},

abstract={Globalization, Industry 4.0 and increasing price pressure are only a few impact factors influencing the competition in capital goods industry. Thus, the manufacturers need to differentiate by creating individual bundles, consisting of technical products and lifecycle-oriented services, called Product-Service Systems (PSS). There is an increasing demand of availability-oriented PSS, in which the manufacturer guarantees the availability of the technical product and takes over a part of the customer's manufacturing risk. PSS can be offered by means of different business models. This article presents a novel concept to develop availability-oriented business models, which considers requirement elicitation for technical development of smart machine components, and customer-oriented methods of design thinking approach, i.e. Persona analysis, Value-network mapping and Customer Journey. The concept was validated in three use cases, regarding technology-push and market-pull perspective. © 2017 The Authors.},

abstract={Today's mankind and all human activities are constantly changing and evolving in response to changes in technology, social and economic environments and climate. Those changes drive a "new" way of manufacturing industry. That novelty could be described as the organization of production processes based on technology and devices autonomously communicating with each other along the value chain. Decision-makers have to address this novelty (usually named as Industry 4.0) and try to develop appropriate information systems, physical facilities, and different kind of technologies capable of meeting the future needs of economy. As a consequence, there is a need for new paradigms of the way freight is move, store, realize, and supply through the world (logistics system). One of the proposed solutions is the Physical Internet, concept of open global logistics system which completely redefines current supply chain configuration, business models, and value-creation patterns.However, further detailed research on this topic is much needed. This paper aims to provide a balanced review of the variety of views considered among professionals in the field of Physical Internet with the final aim to identify the biggest challenges (technological, societal, business paradigm) of proposed new logistics paradigm as a practical solution in supporting Industry 4.0. © 2016 M.

abstract={In the framework of Industry 4.0, collaborative manufacturing across different supply chains is one of the most important business models. In order to avoid the uneven distribution of service requirements among service providers (i.e., non-equalization phenomenon), a lot of service strategies with different characteristics can be taken as candidate solutions to adjust the matching between service providers and service consumers. Based on the background, how to identify the application conditions of various service strategies in complex environment has become a serious challenge in the field. To solve this problem, the computational experiment-based evaluation method is proposed in this paper, including customization of service strategy, construction of experiment system, and experiment analysis of service strategy. In this paper, three possible service strategies are built to deal with the non-equalization phenomenon, i.e., non-equalization strategy, equalization strategy, collaborative equalization strategy. Experiment results show that: collaborative equalization strategy can effectively enhance the service utilization rate and reduce the completion time in short supply environment; equalization strategy is the optimal one in oversupply market environment. This case study can show that the proposed method is feasible and the result is satisfactory. © 2008-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={The following article presents a brief literature review conducted to extend our knowledge about how Industry 4.0 affects business models and to identify business model innovations derived in consequence. Based on the results, a set of features, issues and requirements have been identified and three different approaches has been suggested to make firms getting closer to the industry 4.0 phenomenon such as service orientation, networked ecosystems and customer orientation. Furthermore, the impacts on the creation, delivery, and capture of value through the reconfiguration of Business Models due to embracing the Industry 4.0 are depicted. As a result, four different ways to innovate the business models based on different degrees of innovation are proposed to embrace the digitalization. Those paths goes from optimizing internal and external processes or improving customer relationship to creating new value networks or smart products and services through disruptive business models. © 2018 The Authors.

abstract={The fourth industrial revolution, Industry 4.0, is expected to cause disruptive changes in industrial production. It is driven by rapid technological developments and the need for manufacturing companies to make themselves independent of high labor costs. Industry 4.0 concerns several aspects of industrial production, including manufacturing logistics, business models and products and services. The applications of Industry 4.0 have been vastly outlined. However, the fit of Industry 4.0 applications in different production environments is not clear. The purpose of this paper is to identify and investigate the Industry 4.0 technologies that are applicable to manufacturing logistics, and how the production environment influences the applicability of these technologies. This is done through a multiple case study of four Norwegian manufacturing companies. The findings from the study indicate that the applicability of Industry 4.0 in manufacturing logistics is dependent on the production environment. Companies with a low degree of production repetitiveness see less potential in applying Industry 4.0 technologies in manufacturing logistics, while companies with a highly repetitive production see a higher potential. © 2017, Shanghai University and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Industry 4.0 heralds the profound transformation of business models by enabling the fusion of virtual and real worlds and the application of digitization, automatization and robotics in manufacturing. We review the basic premises of Industry 4.0 and map them against the clusters’ features with the aim to establish the kind of relations between these two categories. By exploring the likely impact of clusters on Industry 4.0, our discussion revolves around the broader question of the role of regional ecosystems in industrial transformation. Clusters, thanks to the advantages such as knowledge base and mechanisms, agglomeration economies and externalities (labour pool and critical mass of firms) and favourable more stable, less uncertain environment of trust and cooperation, may facilitate the digital transformation, particularly its phasing-in and testing phases. Notwithstanding this potential, it should be stressed that not all clusters would be able to play such prominent role. Only these equipped with adequate knowledge base and providing some expertise in the field of IT solutions, robotics, automatics, and so on, i.e. the technologies crucial to Industry 4.0 seem predestined to contribute to the emergence of fully fledged industrial internet. Despite seemingly some inconsistency between these two categories, clusters can facilitate the business transformation towards Industry 4.0. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={The successful initiation and deployment of Smart Grid has stimulated new demands and challenges on the energy supply and distribution side. The emerging new entities participating in electricity, gas and heat network make it an imminent task to recognize and manage them in an integrated fashion, hence rendering Smart Grid gradually evolving towards global energy interconnection (GPEI). In this paper, the novel concept and framework of GPEI are proposed. The integration and interaction on various levels in GPEI are explained and active participants in each layer of GPEI framework are identified. Much like the formation of smart grid and GPEI, the technological concepts of cyber-physical systems, the internet of things (IoT) and the internet of services facilitates the vision of Industry 4.0 which was recently brought forward. Opportunities for business model innovations and added value streams present themselves by opening a dialogue between GEI and Industry 4.0. © 2016, Power System Technology Press.

abstract={Smart devices and cyber-physical systems, which are interconnected to IT systems and services, form the basis for the arising Internet of Everything, opening up new economic opportunities for its participants and users beyond its technological aspects and challenges. While today's e-business scenarios are mostly dominated by a few centralized online platforms, future business models, which will be feasible for the Internet of Everything, need to address special requirements. Such business models, e.g., leveraging the possibilities of smart cities, need to cope with arbitrary combinations of products and services orchestrated into complex products in a highly distributed and dynamic environment. Furthermore, these arbitrary combinations are influenced by real-time context information derived from sensor networks or IT systems, as well as the users' requirements and preferences. The complexity of finding the optimal product/service combination overstrains users and leads to decisions according to the principle of adverse selection (i.e., choosing good enough instead of optimal). Such e-business models require an appropriate underlying value generation architecture that supports users in this process. In this paper, we develop a business model that addresses these problems. In addition, we present the Distributed Market Spaces (DMS) software-system architecture as a possible implementation, which enables the aforementioned decentralized and context-centric e-business scenario and leverages the commercial possibilities of smart cities. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyze the current state of fabrication laboratories (Fab Lab), an international network of digital laboratories, which provides new technological tools for digital manufacturing that can be used from individual users, to small businesses and schools. The aim is to understand similarities and differences of skills, technologies used and customers served among the main European laboratories (Italy, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain) and the American ones. Design/methodology/approach: Data from European and American Fab Labs were collected using a questionnaire survey performed on a total sample of n=493 Fab Labs. The administration of the survey took place through e-mail; 73 Fab Labs participated to the survey, reaching a total response rate of 14.81 percent. Findings: The results show that Italian laboratories are characterized by ample space available, but limited capacity for investment in machinery and technology. European Fab Labs are similar to the Italian Fab Labs, while the American ones are more heterogeneous in size. However, a fact that emerges clearly from the results is how American Fab Labs are more important realities than European ones in terms of turnover and investments. They are more similar to businesses with an independent financial support. Originality/value: The novelty of the study resides in the issue considered and the experimental techniques used. Some qualitative case studies have been developed in the field, but no previous quantitative analyses have been developed on a large sample of Fab Labs, developing comparisons between European and American realities of these digital laboratories. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The issue of sustainability is becoming more and more important because of the increase in the human population and the extraction of non-renewable natural resources. We can make decisive steps towards sustainability in the fields of logistics services by improvement of logistics processes and/or application of new environment-friendly technologies. These steps are very important for companies because they have a significant effect on competitiveness. Nowadays significant changes are taking place in applied methods and technologies in the fields of logistics services as part of the 4th Industrial Revolution. Most companies are not able to keep pace with these changes in addition to carrying out their main activities by using own resources; consequently, in many cases logistics services are outsourced in the interest of maintaining or increasing competitiveness. The currently applied outsourcing examination process contains numerous shortcomings. We have elaborated a new business model to eliminate these shortcomings, namely the basic concept for an outsourcing investigation system integrated in the electronic marketplace. The paper introduces the current process of logistics service outsourcing examination and the elaborated business model concept. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={The growing prevalence of technology-driven concepts, such as the "Internet of things" or "Industry 4.0", holds substantial potentials for service sectors worldwide. In this context, "Smart Services" describe data-based, individually configurable bundles of physically delivered services, digital services as well as physical products, which are usually performed on integrated platforms. Due to their complexity and the integration of data from customers and other stakeholders as a key resource for value creation, Smart Services are performed in complex Ecosystems (e.g. in collaboration between technology, software as well as service specialists and users). However, Value Co-creation in Smart Service Ecosystems requires an adaption of stakeholderś existing business models. Smart Service platforms need to consider value contributions of other actors, when defining their business models and vice versa. Based on the use case of Smart City Services our paper illustrates the need for developing Smart Service Business Models collaboratively between ecosystem stakeholders and provides insights about appropriate methods for doing so. © 2017 PICMET.},

abstract={This paper presents our architectural approach to building a collaborative Industry 4.0 platform that enables IoT-based real-time monitoring, optimization and negotiation in manufacturing supply chains. The platform is called NIMBLE and is currently being developed in a European research project. The presented approach utilizes microservice technology, and implements the core business functionality of the platform through a composition of decentralized, scalable services. The communication among services, and with platform users, manufacturers, suppliers, sensors and Web resources, is supported through simple protocols and lightweight mechanisms. Core business services of the implemented architecture are released as open source software, enabling multiple prospective platform-providers to establish B2B marketplaces for collaboration within their own industrial sector or region. To demonstrate microservices in practice, we present two scenarios, both related to manufacturing of wooden home buildings: one is IoT-based data sharing in a supply chain, and the other deals with product driven logistics planning. The further development of the platform will be driven by the requirements of at least four different use cases throughout Europe, and by incorporating advanced business models to support the growth of powerful network effects of the platform. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Although 3D printing has attracted remarkable attention from both industry and academia society, still only a relatively small number of people have access to required 3D printers and know how to use them. One of the challenges is that how to fill the gap between the unbalanced supply of various 3D printing capabilities and the customized demands from geographically distributed customers. The integration of 3D printing into cloud manufacturing may promote the development of future smart networks of virtual 3D printing cloud, and allow a new serviceoriented 3D printing business model to achieve mass customization. This paper presents a primary 3D printing cloud model and an advanced 3D printing cloud model, and analyzes the 3D printing service delivery paradigms in the models. Further, the paper proposes a 3D printing cloud platform architecture design to support the advanced model. The proposed advanced 3D printing cloud model as well as the architecture design can provide a reference for the development of various 3D printing clouds. Copyright © 2016 by ASME.},

abstract={The hype concerning digitalization is increasing the demand for new generations of automation systems. Concepts like Reference Architecture Model Industry 4.0 (RAMI 4.0) give us models but do not tell us how to facilitate actual implementations. This article discusses the transition from legacy automation technology as defined by ISA-95 to highly distributed Internet of Things (IoT)-and system of systems (SoS)-based automation systems that fully utilize Internet technologies, thus enabling the implementation of Industry 4.0 and RAMI 4.0 models. Distributed IoT automation systems have a number of general requirements concerning real-time performance, security, engineering cost, scalability, and interoperability. Meeting these requirements is necessary to enable possibilities for a realworld implementation of IoT automation. A key concept is local automation clouds. The discussion is based on a particular example of such an automation integration platform, the Arrowhead Framework. © 2007-2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Industry is facing a historic turning point [1]. In industry 4.0, people, machines and products communicate with one another via the internet. This means the convergence of industry and Internet technology. Modern machines allow companies to exploit the potential of digitalization in their production facilities and to unlock new business fields. The mechanical engineering sector have to know how new technologies can be successfully integrated for the benefit of the customer. Production processes and supply chains will become more efficient, with advances in productivity and huge savings in material and energy. Digitalization goes hand in hand with the growing importance of platforms for data exchange, customer contact and services. Online platforms facilitate market access, reduce transaction costs and enable innovation through new business models. Machines are connected around the world, so Industry 4.0 would not be possible without networks and data traffic. © 2017 The Author(s)},

abstract={Industry 4.0 can be said to be the current trend of automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies. Originally, the term "Industrie 4.0" is from a project in the high-tech strategy of the German government, which hope to promote the computerization of manufacturing. Usually involves terms like cyber-physical systems, Internet of things, amd cloud computing. For now, Industry 4.0 becomes an emerging buzzword that is gaining significant interest among all stakeholders of the global industry-related R&D market from academia to international companies. It is a new business model attracting much interest, yet the definitions are not very matured and is an amazing melting pot of disruptive technologies. No doubt, to maximize the impact of Industry 4.0, researchers from different fields and industry have to work together applying the new technologies in practice. On the top of the wave, it is timely to analyze the cross section who can benefit from the novel achievements of Industry 4.0.},

abstract={The fourth industrial revolution and the digital transformation are already major factors in the manufacturing industry and their importance is ever growing. However, the degree of their practical implementation has to be scrutinized. To define a status quo, it is important to analyze the situation and to identify deficits, starting points and unexploited potentials. Still, a detailed understanding of the fourth industrial revolution and the digital transformation is lacking especially in small and medium sized manufacturing companies. In addition, the fourth industrial revolution is associated by most companies only with logistics as well as production and manufacturing areas. The opportunities to integrate additional functional areas of the production process and the vertical value chain into the concept of the fourth industrial revolution are hardly considered. Starting from the point of view that the fourth industrial revolution is defined as a systematic increase in the flexibility of products and processes through automation, extensive networking and decentralized control mechanisms, as well as a data acquisition and integration through information and communication technologies, a study concept is developed. For this purpose, it is not enough to ask only for the present prevalence of technologies of the fourth industrial revolution. It is necessary to analyze the processes within manufacturing companies. A survey concept is developed that initially breaks down the vertical value chain as well as the production process into specific sub-processes. These sub-processes are analyzed regarding their degree of automation and digitalization and networking among themselves. The results of this survey presents concisely the call for action, the state of implementation and realized solutions of the fourth industrial revolution in Germany. Furthermore, impulses and best practices for innovative products and business models can be given. © 2016 The Authors.},

abstract={Since the industrial revolution, we have been living in a linear economy. Our consumer and “single use” lifestyles have made the planet a “take, make, dispose” world. This refers to a unidirectional model of production: natural resources provide our factory inputs, which are then used to create mass-produced goods to be purchased and, typically, disposed after a single use. This linear economy model of mass production and mass consumption is testing the physical limits of the globe. It is, therefore, unsustainable and a shift toward a circular economy is becoming inevitable. © 2018, © The Regents of the University of California 2018.},

abstract={Industry 4.0 (I4.0) also known as the fourth industrial revolution has emerged for describing the digitalization of manufacturing industries. In practice, the transition to I4.0 is crucial for manufacturing firms to sustain competitive advantage and seize new opportunities. Most research focuses on the technological aspects of I4.0 in form of product and process innovations. Despite I4.0's rising attention among both researchers and practitioners, there exists only little research about I4.0 business model innovation (BMI), even though business model (BM) innovators can be more successful than product or process innovators. To address this research gap, we analyze 15 case studies of I4.0 BM innovators. We develop a taxonomy to characterize I4.0 BMs and derive 13 archetypes of I4.0 BMIs that describe transitions towards I4.0 BMs. The three identified super-archetypes are integration, servitization and expertise as a service. Our study deepens the understanding and structure of I4.0 BMs and I4.0 BMIs. © 2018 Association for Information Systems. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Circular Economy has been usually indicated as a promising approach to promote economic development and sustainability. Despite this general agreement, the Circular Economy paradigm is still little adopted by companies, as they need to face several challenges. In this context, Product-Service Systems (PSS) Business Models play a major role, as they have been proposed as an opportunity for promoting sustainability. Today, digital technologies are seen as a key factor to enable PSS, allowing at the same time the introduction of Circular Economy into companies. However, little attention has been set on how new digital technologies can overcome in practice the main Circular Economy challenges. To fill this gap, this paper explores such a role through a case study of a company who leverages Internet of Things, Big Data and Analytics in the provision of its PSS Business Model. Based on the findings of the empirical investigation, the role that the selected digital technologies play in overcoming the Circular Economy challenges is presented and discussed. © 2018 The Authors.

abstract={In today's turbulently expanding business environment, during the fourth industrial revolution, it is necessary to respond to market trends and to adapt strategy and organisational structure appropriately. The article is focused on the reorganisation and optimisation of the business organisation structure of global companies. The purpose of this paper is to analyse and evaluate the use of the territorial business structure, within the framework of a global company, based on experimental research. Experiences with the introduction of a territorial organisational structure in a corporate enterprise have proven to be highly effective long-term, with productivity and sales volumes increasing. This territorial setting can be considered as a competitive advantage, which matches predicted market trends and is suitable for global businesses. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={The fourth industrial revolution (Industrie 4.0) is distinguished by a growing network and intelligence of machines, products, services and data. This results in new business models and value chains, but also various risks, e.g. by hacker attacks, data theft or manipulation. Many companies consider Industrie 4.0 much as a security challenge other than an opportunity or enabler for new business models. Therefore, effective security methods to protect the Industrie 4.0 systems and its associated values and assets are needed. One of the aims of Industrie 4.0 is identifying and developing new, appropriate security practices for enterprises and especially for their production systems. Based on the connectivity infrastructure in the shop floor, the diversity in the corporate landscape of the global mechanical and plant engineering ultimately causes that every company has to develop its own way of IT and production security management. In the context of Industrie 4.0, an integral concept is needed, that connects the requirements from manufacturing automation and mechanical engineering to process engineering with the properties of cyber-physical systems as an Industrie 4.0 component and well-established core elements of IT security descriptions. Standards from industry associations and standardization committees have to be included. In this paper, a process model is developed, which consults RAMI 4.0 and well-established core elements of safety and IT security considering the standards IEC 61508 and IEC 62443. A use case driven approach is developed with the goal to demonstrate the functionalities and validation of the process model. In different iterations, the dynamic change of the system by mapping IT security requirements on system assets and processes will be presented. The purpose of the developed process model is to assign security measures to vulnerabilities and threats of a system for Industrie 4.0. © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier.},

abstract={Manufacturing is undergoing a period of intense change as a result of advanced smart technologies, such as real-time sensors and the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). This has paved the way for a new era of digitized manufacturing known as Industry 4.0. It is anticipated that Industry 4.0 will be disruptive enough to present both new opportunities and threats to firms within a new competitive landscape. Manufacturers will be forced to adopt new business models to effectively capture value from the emerging smart technologies. A literature review revealed that few studies have addressed business models for Industry 4.0. Hence, this research addresses: What fundamental principles should companies in the manufacturing industry consider when adopting a data-driven business model? An analysis of four case studies on data-driven business models revealed significant common attributes. Through a SWOT analysis, twelve model principles for implementing a data-driven value capture framework could be identified. © 2017 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Many companies in the German mechanical engineering and related industries need to transform from a product manufacturer to a problem solver. Against the background of Industry 4.0 the discussion is more and more about new business models. The main success potential for companies lays in the early and integrative development of product concept, production system concept and a promising business model. The paper at hands discusses business models within the product engineering process and success factors. Furthermore an approach is introduced towards a discursive business model development. Finally the possibilities of business model patterns are discussed. © 2014, Carl Hanser Verlag, München.},

abstract={Sustainable development and the circular economy are two important issues for the future and the competitiveness of businesses. The programs for the integration of sustainability into industrial activities include the reconfiguration of production processes with a view to reducing their impact on the natural system, the development of new eco-sustainable products and the redesign of the business model. This paradigm shift requires the participation and commitment of different stakeholder groups and industry can completely redesign supply chains, aiming at resource efficiency and circularity. Developments in key ICT technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), help this systemic transition. This paper explores the phases of the transition from a linear to a circular economy and proposes a procedure for introducing the principles of sustainability (environmental, economic and social) in a manufacturing environment, through the design of a new Circular Business Model (CBM). The new procedure has been tested and validated in an Italian company producing ceramic tiles, using the digitalization of the production processes of the Industry 4.0 environment, to implement the impact assessment tools (LCA-Life Cycle Assessment, LCC-Life Cycle Costing and S-LCA-Social Life Cycle Assessment) and the business intelligence systems to provide appropriate sustainability performance indicators essential for the definition of the new CBM. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={The article investigates the role of business model innovation by Industry 4.0 solution providers and their impact on process innovation of their customers. Industry 4.0 solution providers are hereby seen as the enablers and providers of Industry 4.0 technologies, which provide access to several potentials of Industry 4.0 technologies to their customers. In particular, the role of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that provide solutions that are based on Industry 4.0 technologies for their customers are investigated, which in turn can improve and innovate their own processes. Frist, the article presents an overview of the current state of research and a brief theoretical background. Second, the article bases its findings on an empirical study of 111 Industry 4.0 providers from Germany that are SMEs. Analyzing the results of questionnaires, correlations between Industry 4.0 solutions and two perspectives are examined: benefits for the solution providers and benefits for process improvements and innovations of the customers. Subsequently, the article discusses these findings, closing the article with both managerial and research implications. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={Purpose: While digitisation is a key driver of the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0); organisations have different approaches to deal with this topic to get a clearer picture of the opportunities and challenges concerning the digital transformation. The purpose of this paper is to identify the impact of digitisation on procurement and its role within the area of supply chain management. The research will also explore potential barriers to digitising procurement and supply chains and ways to overcome them. Finally, the significance of potential enabling technologies to the digitisation will also be examined. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative approached utilising an online survey was used to collect the primary data for this study. Data were collected from 414 participants directly involved with procurement or related business functions and work for different organisations in different industries. The survey included eight items about the impact of digitisation on organisational performance in the area of procurement and supply chains; ten items related to key barriers to digitisation of organisations and ways to overcome them; and seven items about enabling technologies to leverage procurement procedures and processes digitisation. All of these items utilised the Likert five-point level of agreement scale. Findings: The findings indicate that digitisation of procurement process can yield several benefits including: supporting daily business and administrative tasks, supporting complex decision-making processes, procurement will become more focussed on strategic decisions and activities, procurement will become a strategic interface to support organisational efficiency, effectiveness, and profitability, and supporting the creation of new business models, products, and services. The authors were also able to confirm that there are barriers to digitising procurement process and supply chains and such barriers found in existing procedures, processes, capacities, and capabilities. Finally, the significance of a number of enabling technologies to the digitisation process was revealed. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study of its kind with participants located world-wide. Industry 4.0 as a topic had been explored within different business areas and functions but very limited research specifically explored potential impact, barriers, and enabling technologies of procurement 4.0. The results can be beneficial for organisations already implemented Industry 4.0 or planning to do so. The study can also benefit academic scholars interested in the researched topic, business professionals, organisations within different sectors, and any other party interested in understanding more the concept of procurement 4.0. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Skilled shop-floor technicians are playing an important role in modern Industry 4.0 manufacturing environments, especially in small and customized manufacturing systems. Moving towards Industry 4.0 business models, it is essential to develop advanced solutions that will reinforce the position of technicians in manufacturing, by implementing key enabling technologies. Augmented Reality (AR) has arisen as a key enabling technology, which will enable the transfer of information from digitalized design systems and databases towards human operators, especially including production and maintenance information. Reinforced by the development of advanced communication technologies that support high speed data transfer, such as 5G, and networks that combine low latency with increased availability, such as tactile internet, AR proposes a way for agile information distribution and increased shop-floor status awareness. This study presents a mobile application for visualizing Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) instructions for bending processes using Augmented Reality. The application integrates step-by-step process instructions, highly usable menus and advanced visualization that includes safety zones, indications, and text instructions for the operators. The developed framework is applied and validated in a CNC bending machine in a real world scenario provided by a CNC machines manufacturer. © 2018 EW materials. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The digital transformation of economies is one of the megatrends of today’s world. The advancing equipment of machines and products with sensors and connectivity as well as their intelligent interconnection among each other leads to a mergence between physical and virtual worlds. This development is not limited to smart production systems in terms of an “Industry 4.0” only, but will also affect the increasingly important service business of manufacturing companies. Regarding “Smart Services” (data-based bundles of services, digital applications and technologies), the development of appropriate business models is seen as a key challenge for companies. Our paper illustrates how the approach “Value Proposition Design” can support manufacturing firms to develop Smart Service Business Models. Thus, we present insights from an applied research project, in which two different Business Model alternatives have been derived from applying Value Proposition Design. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.},

abstract={Industry 4.0 is an important trend aiming at increasing competitiveness and rebalancing value creation in global networks. It targets the reduction of production costs while improving product quality and production scalability and individualization by means of digitalization of product and production. Products as well as their production are becoming cognitive and can therefore better adapt to given customer needs or production variations. In this paper, we discuss impacts of Industry 4.0 along the entire automotive supply chain. In particular, we illustrate that Industry 4.0 in the automotive context has a high cross-impact between development, production, operation and maintenance, thus requiring innovative solutions along the entire value creation chain. We enhance the commonly understood scope of Industry 4.0 towards digitalization over the entire product lifecycle and introduce data-driven business models to support exploitation of opportunities coming from this digitalization over the supply chain. We also propose a seamless cost engineering discipline in the automotive context for enabling a more systematic analysis and monitoring of the foreseen production costs from early development phase until SOP. This leverages system optimization to fulfil customer expectations from a functional, contextual and from an affordability point of view. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.},

abstract={Purpose: Today’s generations face the effect that knowledge is no more usable for decades or even centuries. The pace of change as well as its profoundness has reached levels that cause massive changes in companies, but also whole societies. Some call this phenomenon the 4th industrial revolution or Industry 4.0. Others use the term “digital transformation”. Does this mean that quality managers are becoming obsolete soon? How do the Quality occupations adopt? Which changes need to be accomplished in the field of Quality occupations to provide sustainable competencies for future employees? What tasks and functions need to be carried out? And how can these tasks be defined on a universal basis that fits for different kind of branches as well as small and big companies? Design/methodology/approach: Based on Abbotts “System of Professions”, the development of a transformation concept for Quality occupations is carried out. The purpose of this paper is to define basic professional positions in the field of Quality Engineering regarding quality assurance (QA) and quality management (QM) as well as from an operative to a strategic level. Tasks and responsibilities of todays and future businesses models are clustered and enhanced or specified. In a survey, which included 389 executive managers in Germany, the German Association of Quality elevated those jurisdictions and their competences of QA and QM professionals. The results are used to define the new role bundle model for Quality occupations in Germany. Findings: The innovative and sustainable role bundle model offers defined Quality occupations for future business models needed for the 4th digital revolution. Thereby, not every role has to be taken by a separate employee in a business organisation. By offering different kind of clusters, the role bundle model helps to create agile role profiles regarding the actual business situation and its size. This way, tasks and jurisdictions within the business organisation can be adapted fast to the changes of the business organisation. Originality/value: The innovative concept is based on two success criteria: the creation of Quality occupations according to the changes of digital transformation and a survey involving more than 350 German executive managers in the field of Quality. Based on the results, a role bundle model for Quality occupations is designed that helps to coordinate education programmes at universities and professional trainings in Germany. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The fourth industrial revolution, so-called Industry 4.0 is triggered by digitalization of manufacturing industries. According to global studies, Industry 4.0 will have significant positive impact in sense of revenue and cost reduction, but it will trigger also change and transformation of business, and the only actors, who can keep up with this transformation, and come up with innovative business models, can take advantages of this revolution. The value proposition proposed in those business models, nowadays are created collaboratively with using several intellectual properties, targeting characteristics of complex and relatively new market structures. We propose a model-driven approach and a corresponding toolkit, so-called “Business Modelling Infrastructure” that supports those actors during configuring their value propositions and business models, with knowing which characteristics of which market segment they are targeting and what kind of intellectual properties do they need to use and what are their dependencies and limitations. The work in the hand presents also a business modelling case for additive manufacturing, where the Business Modelling Infrastructure is applied. Finally, the work evaluates the Business Modelling Infrastructure with giving preliminary results from that business modelling case. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

abstract={The various potentials, technologies of the fourth industrial revolution and related disruptive business models enable smart factories in highly efficient production networks. The different influences of the increasing networking for production processes and innovative business models will have a fundamental impact on existing value creation systems. Value creation systems put business models into operation. Certain aspects of these models will be changed more and more quickly and even the business partners will shift. Based on the demands for individual products in batch production, companies are faced with the challenge to create complex and flexible value creations networks. For the implementation of modern value creation structures, comprehensive modifications in the organisational structure are essential. Among adjustments in the internal structure of a company, modifications in the external value creation are also necessary. In the course of the steady rise of information and communication technologies, products get smarter. For companies, this requires new know-how in unknown fields. The paper at hand presents an approach to support companies in designing sustainable value creation structures based on changes of the business models.},

abstract={Sustainability is a complex but extremely important issue. To achieve a new industrial revolution that focuses on sustainability, we need innovation. Merely improving our technologies and our habits will not save our planet from its current gradual degradation. In recent decades many Eco-tools have been developed; this paper evaluates some of the most used methods, how they help to consider sustainability in the product development process and identify important and missing characteristics, arguing that many eco-tools were experienced by the companies as too complex and time-consuming and often not aiding a radical innovation process. These characteristics guided the development of a framework with creative methods for sustainability driven innovation based on a multidisciplinary workshop approach. It focuses on analyzing customers from a sustainable viewpoint, understanding their real needs, using ideation tools to generate ideas in areas not usually considered in current eco-tools, e.g. changing customer behavior or the business model. The method was developed, tested and evaluated in an iterative approach over a six-month period. Copyright © 2002-2012 The Design Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The concept of "Industry 4.0" is expected to bring a multitude of benefits for industrial value creation. However, the associated risks hamper its implementation and lack a comprehensive overview. In response, the paper proposes a framework of risks in the context of Industry 4.0 that is related to the Triple Bottom Line of sustainability. The framework is developed from a literature review, as well as from 14 in-depth expert interviews. With respect to economic risks, the risks that are associated with high or false investments are outlined, as well as the threatened business models and increased competition from new market entrants. From an ecological perspective, the increased waste and energy consumption, as well as possible ecological risks related to the concept "lot size one", are described. From a social perspective, the job losses, risks associated with organizational transformation, and employee requalification, as well as internal resistance, are among the aspects that are considered. Additionally, risks can be associated with technical risks, e.g., technical integration, information technology (IT)-related risks such as data security, and legal and political risks, such as for instance unsolved legal clarity in terms of data possession. Conclusively, the paper discusses the framework with the extant literature, proposes managerial and theoretical implications, and suggests avenues for future research. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={The so-called fourth industrial revolution features the application of modern Information & Communication Technology (ICT) concepts and technologies in industrial contexts to create more flexible and innovative products and services leading to new business models and added value. The emerging Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is one of the main results of this revolution. One of the most known and adopted communication protocol in the context of the fourth industrial revolution is OPC UA (IEC 62541). Although this standard already combines features coming from both industrial and ICT contexts, current literature presents several approaches aimed to introduce ICT enhancements into OPC UA in order to further improve its usability in industrial environments. Some of these approaches are based on the proposal to make OPC UA RESTful, due to many advantages of RESTful services in industrial settings. OPC UA is based on a client/server architecture and adopts an information model at the server side, whose access from the client side requires knowledge of a data model, whose structure is sometimes complex, creating some difficulties for a resource-constrained device acting as client. The paper proposes the definition of a web platform able to offer access to OPC UA servers through a REST architecture. The approach presented in the paper differs from other existing solutions, mainly because it allows to realise a lightweight OPC UA RESTful interface reducing the complexity of the basic knowledge to be held by a generic user of the platform. For this reason, the solution presented allows enhancement of OPC UA interoperability towards resource-constrained devices. The web platform has been implemented and the relevant code is available on GitHub. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technology developments in Cloud Manufacturing (CMfg) are challenging traditional business models, and adapting these is key to a sustainable competitive advantage. In parallel, pay-per-use strategies are being discussed as an enabler to future sustainable societies. The general benefits of CMfg services are clear, but to date the actual business implications from a service provider perspective have not been discussed. This article explores new business model opportunities based on the idea of providing CMfg as a completely new type of Product-Service Systems. Technology developments and business recommendations are defined, considering the proposed business model targets the manufacturing industry as a whole. Manufacturers make use of their spare capacity by purchasing time on networked equipment on a pay-per-use basis. This allows costs to be brought down, whilst creating new revenue streams. It also increases machine hosts’ competitiveness by reducing investment costs and enabling instant manufacturing scalability. CMfg is then classified into three levels of machine autonomy, arguing that as technology develops intermediaries may slowly integrate vertically and eventually replace manufacturers by completely autonomous equipment. The proposed business model presents both a first step and a baseline point of reference towards bridging the gap between advanced manufacturing technology and new business development in the context of I4.0 (Smart Manufacturing). © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={The idea of Collaborative Manufacturing, also known as the Production Networks or Social Manufacturing, has been around for more than 25 years. It is a production concept based on non-hierarchical collaboration among enterprises often referred as Virtual Enterprise (VE). Despite many scientific research and projects with this topic, it is difficult to find an example of fully operational non-hierarchical production network anywhere in the world. However, that fact could be changed very soon. Namely, the new industrial revolution, called Industry 4.0, encourages industrial enterprises to adopt information-communication technology (ICT) and Internet of Things (IoT) into their production systems, thus creating Cyber-Physical Production System (CPPS). From the aspect of production networks, CPPS represents crucial infrastructure, or a missing link between enterprises. Now, with CPPS in place, non-hierarchical networking and collaboration becomes possible through Smart Collaborative Production Networks. In this research, the concept of information system for Smart Collaborative Production Networks was developed and called ‘VENTIS’. Although the idea of the concept is to manage the collaboration inside Virtual Enterprise, in this research, a special focus has been put on manufacturing planning phase in which optimization problem known as the Partner Selection Problem (PSP) occurs. Since the PSP in manufacturing phase is far more complex than partner selection during the collaborative product development phase, new research premises regarding the Virtual Enterprise type have been set. Two types of Virtual Enterprise business models – Push-type and Pull-type – have been defined in this research. If VE is Push-type, HUMANT algorithm is used to solve PSP that occurs in that case. If VE is Pull-type, a special procedure, inspired by phenomenological reduction, has been established in which set of a priori created VEs is compared with theoretically ‘the best’ VE and theoretically ‘the worst’ VE. Enterprises’ data of production network from Dalmatia (Split-Dalmatia County, Croatia) is used as a Case Study to present ‘VENTIS’ concept and to present the procedure for creation of sustainable Virtual Enterprise. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The term additive manufacturing (AM) groups together a set of technologies with similar characteristics forming part of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. AM is being developed globally, as evidenced by the standards published by and the agreements between the ISO and the ASTM in 2013. The purpose of this paper is to anticipate the main changes that will occur in AM by 2030 as forecast by more than 100 Spanish experts through Delphi prospection performed in 2018. In this way, the areas, aspects, and business models with the greatest probabilities of occurrence are obtained. The need for technical experts with specific knowledge and skills requires changes to current training syllabuses. Such changes will enable students to have the profiles foreseen in these job trends. The encouragement of STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) training through the introduction of AM in study plans may be an appropriate alternative. Finally, the consequences of the Fourth Industrial Revolution for the employment market and on jobs, particularly in Spain, are set out and the latest Spanish Research, Development, and Innovation (R & D + I) plans are summarized as the framework for the possible implementation and development of AM. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={The fourth industrial revolution requires higher capabilities of changeability and reconfigurability (C–R) of the future factories (FoF), as well as a higher focus on business models that are based on total-cost-of-ownership (TCO) paradigm. Up to date, there are little scientific contributions to deploy C–R into TCO models, as well as to systematic plan and design manufacturing resources such as to facilitate FoF ecosystem. In order to address this issue, this paper introduces research results that show how to deploy C–R, connectivity, smartness and TCO requirements into the technical solutions of manufacturing resources of FoF. Contributions emerging from this research include an index to measure C–R capability of manufacturing resources, a model to assess economic feasibility of a FoF over its lifecycle, as well as a methodology and related tools to design smart connected manufacturing resources with embedded features to facilitate changeability and reconfigurability in a FoF. Theoretical contributions are explained through a case study of a fast reconfigurable robotic manufacturing cell. Preliminary results demonstrate that it is possible to rapid design smart connected manufacturing resources and integrate them into FoF architectures that support convertibility, integrability, modifiability, adaptability, serviceability, scalability, integration of resources from various producers, service clustering and cloud-based services. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={With the advent of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and cyber-physical systems, the multi-disciplinary area of mechatronics has become pervasive in “smart industry.” The infusion of the cloud IoT model to the business processes has broaden the horizon for the grocery business. This study puts forward an innovative design of a retail business model and its implementation, using sensor-based measurement containers (SBMCs) and an Android application, which contributes new ideas for the international community. SBMCs containers are employed in the system to mitigate the pressure related to a cloud IOT-enabled grocery management system (CE-GMS) for the management of necessary household commodities, by sensing their quantities on hand using an ultrasonic sensor. It allows an alert to be generated when the item quantities reach the reorder point. The proposed CE-GMS consists of four automated entities: production units, warehouses, stores and customer sites – all of which are equipped with SBMCs of varying physical capacities. Cloud computing aids the systems to communicate with each other for better coordination. The automated information flow from a customer's SBMCs is handled by the nearest store. The data in the store's containers are received by the warehouses, and the data in the warehouse's SBMCs is sent to the production units. This communication among entities occurs with the support of GPS and GSM modules. The entity which receives information has the responsibility for supplying the necessary commodity products, by sensing the demand of the entity regarding commodity depletion. Further, the articles discusses the locking mechanism in SBMCs, inventory monitoring and container tracking for interaction in CE-GMS to validate the grocery market's operations using an IoT-compliant layer. © 2018},

abstract={In recent years and in the current industrial and societal scenario, technologies have been increasingly playing a key role in enabling new product and service offerings. Cyber-physical systems, Additive Manufacturing, Augmented Reality and Cloud Computing are some of the innovative solutions that will shape - or rather are already shaping - new business models and value propositions. Due to that, the industrial application of such technologies is currently under the lens of researchers, practitioners and policymakers. This paper addresses the employment of cutting-edge technologies for Product-Service Systems (PSS) through the definition of a comprehensive classification framework embracing both business and technology-related dimensions taken from literature. Cases from secondary data help draw guidelines from practitioners willing to implement tech-based PSS. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={The so-called fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) is changing the landscape in the manufacturing industry. Although recognized as an essential factor to preserve competitiveness, organizations are still figuring out drivers, enablers and barriers as well as suitable business models to pave the way for innovations in fields such as highly customized products or exponential technologies. The central challenge for a successful adoption of Industry 4.0 is not primarily the required technology, but the emergence and aggregation of a common view and sound models focusing on paramount aspects like quality, customer perception and margins. We argue that available solutions for modeling business strategies fail at providing sufficient guidance for organizations in analyzing opportunities and driving innovations due to their narrow nature as well as missing combination and aggregation possibilities. In contrast, we outline a multi-perspective framework to support organizations in analyzing their context at multiple levels and discuss technological requirements as well as challenges for the development of modeling tools that support hierarchical integration of analyses and models as well as different perspectives to converge on an organization-wide aligned business strategy. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.},

abstract={In a continuously changing business environment and the era of digitalization, business models need to adapt constantly to allow organizations to differentiate themselves from their competitors and to secure their economic survival. However, organizations are neither able to review their business model management nor systemize it productively. Hence, the combination of Industry 4.0, business model and business model management aspects emphasizes an organization's potential and results in an increased competitive and operational success. To guide an organization's advancement, a maturity model for business model management is developed, which delivers assistance suitable to an organization's requirements and strategic orientation. It assesses the organization's current maturity level and proposes sequential steps to advance towards a refined business model and process mastery by indicating improvement potentials. Thus, the maturity model links an organization's existing organizational and operational knowledge to new concepts and makes it accessible through a modified business model for Industry 4.0. © 2018 Leuphana Universitat Luneburg.

abstract={The idea of tight collaboration between Hoesch Hohenlimburg and its business partners has been realized via horizontal and vertical integration. Interaction is built on usage of digital technologies and is intensified along the whole chain of added value creation. In this connection, the ideas, concepts and technologies of Industry 4.0 have been put into practice directly and efficiently. But Industry 4.0 is a continuous process that should serve to development of specific business model and achieving success at customer, thereby it can't be a goal in itself of the technological development. Until today business processes of Hoesch Hohenlimburg were restricted by the framework of its own enterprise. But the project "Variation of production process for medium wide strip", ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) and MES (Manufacturing Execution System) systems have been introduced and the custoners are able now to register directly their orders in the system of Hoesch Hohenlimburg to provide digital business.},

abstract={Industry 4.0 Business Model Innovation for SMEs – Nine-Field Matrix and Morphological Analysis for the Identification and the Design of Information-based Industry 4.0 Business Models for SMEs. The fourth industrial revolution, also known as Industry 4.0, is one of the greatest challenges small and medium-sized enterprises are facing today and in the future. Many of them have been market leaders for decades and have successfully optimized their products and services in an „offline world“. The integration of smart products and services with respect to Industry 4.0 offers new opportunities and levels to create value in the value chain. The identification of these dormant values and the development of new business models are a major obstacle for SMEs today. This article therefore presents a TRIZ-derived Nine-field matrix and a morphological analysis method to support SMEs in information-based Industry 4.0 business model development based on existing products and services. The practical applicability of the method is shown in an industrial case study. © Carl Hanser Verlag GmbH & Co. KG.},

We analysed how companies innovated their business models and how are the new the technology trends. We found out, that have a positive approach to digitalization but the technology strategy still runs its original business model. Digitalization forces to new solution orientation. For companies it is necessary to master the digital transformation, new innovations have to be developed. Furthermore, digitalization / Industry 4.0 linking the real-life factory with virtual reality, will play an increasingly important role in global manufacturing. Companies have to obtain new digital capabilities, in order to make their company sustainable for the future. A long term growth and welfare in Europe could be guaranteed only by new technology innovation. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={This paper provides evidence of the effects of Industry 4.0 technologies on the creation of new businesses by addressing the question: how is 3D printing (3DP) leading to the development of new business models? To this end, I discuss the elements of a business model and the features of Industry 4.0 and 3DP, and I contrast and analyze previous literature regarding the effects of 3DP on business models. Afterwards, I describe the qualitative method (multiple case study) used to gather, compile, and analyze the influence of 3DP on the business models of 25 enterprises. This analysis shows that 3DP may be influencing the development of whole new businesses and business models. Moreover, it is affecting differently the business models of existing enterprises. This paper also explores the concepts of technology complementarity and service complementarity, which seem to be the core elements of the success of enterprises centered on 3DP. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Digitalization is a global change affecting a variety of social conditions and businesses. In addition to changing products and services in businesses and the labour market, digitalization will also create radically new business models in many industries. In parallel to the concept “Industry 4.0”, the paper introduce “Rail 4.0” and “Transport 4.0” as a technological revolution in contemporary rail transport. In Norway, Bane NOR SF will change the existing signalling system with the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) for the entire rail network and introduce a new national Traffic Management System (TMS). This leads to several significant challenges as well as opportunities. The aim of this paper is to highlight key challenges and opportunities of digitalization of the rail network, traffic management and design of traffic control centres. The paper summarizes some experiences from other sectors and relevant stakeholders with regard to traffic control and monitoring. Possibilities and chal-lenges of assessing, planning and constructing new rail TMS and control centres are discussed. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, London.},

abstract={According to the World Economic Forum, in less than five years from now, over one-third of skills that are considered important in today’s workforce will have changed. By 2020, a Fourth Industrial Revolution is expected to have promoted an exponential pace of change in every aspect of how we live and how we work. In a near future, the increase of digital interconnectivity will promote the emergence of new business models that have no longer to be limited by geographic borders and constraints. This may represent major opportunities as well as interesting challenges to low density and peripheral territories. In the light of the disruptive changes driven by this set of events, it is important to assess current workers’ skills in order to develop dedicated strategies that will foster the envisaged skillset alignment. To this end, a pilot experience was developed in the region of Castelo Branco, classified as a peripheral territory in the Portuguese context. Structured and semi-structured interviews were conducted in diverse industrial and service driven companies in order to assess the local workforce language skills, as well as their intercultural communication abilities. Preliminary findings show that even though labourers are aware of their needs related to the aforementioned communication skills, much work is still needed to promote its widespread increase in local companies. © 2016, Editura Cefin.

abstract={As the third wave of the IT following personal computers, the Internet, cloud computing is not only the revolution of modern information technology, but also more of the innovation of modern business model. From cloud computing to cloud services, 'cloud' has led an industrial revolution, and various cloud services emerge endlessly. The cloud computing technology and service innovation in China is in rapid development and areas across the country are advancing corresponding cloud computing and cloud service plans. But with the continued growth of cloud service type and quantity, users are faced with the challenge of how to choose the best cloud services. Based on the analysis of the cloud service, this paper introduces the concept of user community, and combining the collaborative filtering of classical recommendation algorithm and improved K-Means clustering algorithm, it puts forward a new cloud service recommendation algorithm CSRA. A lot of experiments show that under different matrix density and scale of data sets, the mean absolute error of CSRA is smaller than that of UPCC and IPCC, and it has more efficient service to recommend. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Since the establishment of Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) in UK in 1818, the consulting industries have been developing for nearly 200 years. With the rapid development of the worldwide second-wave industrial revolution at the turns of 1900s, consulting industries become urgently needed owning to the social divisions of labor and sophistication of enterprises operations. As for the United States, the origination of management consulting bears deep relation with the scientific management thought of Taylor, and the direct origination is considered as the amalgam of three professions (engineering, law and accounting) and consulting roles of merchant bankers owning to the separation of commercial and investment banks in Depression period around 1930s. The rapid expansion of Chicago and New York-based management consultants and Boston-based consulting engineers lays the foundations of consulting industry for US as well as the world. Chicago acts as the center of US manufacturing and hinterland markets, the agglomeration the of large corporation headquarters would illustrate the fact that it also acts as the major center of management consulting firms during this period. The civil transferring of military strategic institutions and their demonstration provides more possibilities for the development of strategic consulting firms after the Second World War. With the free expertise under Marshall Plan since 1950s, European enterprises are willing to pay managerial guidance of consulting firms, which make it easy for US consulting firms to expand their international businesses. As a result, more consulting enterprises establish their worldwide strategic business unites. Large consulting firms like McKinsey & Co. move their headquarters from Chicago to New York, the easier place for international services at strategic finance and logistics. With the undergoing of Europe Americanization, dissemination of US business models prevails, leaving the opportunities of Boston-based academic-intensive consulting firms such as Boston Consulting Group. The Middle East oil crisis since mid-1970s bring about another radical change for US economy. Cost reduction and structure reorganization becomes radical for the second time, Chicago-rooted management consulting firms, which are good at management of audit, taxation and reorganization (like Anderson), find their values and dominated the consulting markets for a long time. With the outward transferring of traditional manufacturing unites and arising of IT supported knowledge economy since 1990s, US corporations become leading forces through network-based global value chain governance. The management and strategic consulting firms become the outpost forces of world Americanization. Three streams of US based consulting forces looms at large since this period. They are Chicago-rooted reorganization-intended consulting firms, New York-rooted integration-intended consulting firms and Boston-rooted innovation-intended consulting firms. US top consulting firms comes into China in early 1980s mainly at technical consulting with import of technologies and instruments; US and European multinationals comes to China in the form of joint-ventures, bring about the special consulting firms of law and accounting in mid-1980s; Management consulting firms like McKinsey & Co. comes to China in late 1980s, acting as the disseminators of American consulting thoughts. With the reform of Chinese state-run enterprises into stock companies in 1990s, international strategic consulting firms in finance begin to land China. The trajectory of US consulting firms location is from Hong Kong to Shanghai and Bejjing. Their sphere of varies from international investors to domestic enterprises, and from private enterprises to local governments. Advantages of US consulting firms mainly at their regulatory operation, rich experiences, trustworthy behaviors and excellent talents, but there are still several problems such as superficial understanding of Chinese consulting market, west-east cultural conflicts and competitions from domestic rivals. Facing the problems above, the US consulting firms takes strategic actions of localization through employing Chinese talents with overseas education, and joint-training with local educational / academic institutes. Local consulting firms grow up since late 1970s and early 1980s in China. Government invested management and strategic consulting institutes that serve planned sectors and projects begin to establish during this period. Private consulting firms and institutes emerge mainly at information survey and management consulting in early 1990s. At mid 1990s, there is radical change from pure idea and concoctive firms into professional consulting firms. Well-trained MBA and entrepreneurs enter consulting industries at late 1990s, accompanying the establishment of partnership consulting firms. Three major streams of in China: the first force should be overseas consulting firms (like McKinsey & Co.) with market-share of about 50%, the second force is several local consulting firms with annual revenue exceeding 10 million RMB, 10-20%, and the third force is thousands of SMEs with 1-10 million annual revenue. Chinese local consulting firms locate at three areas of Shanghai-centered investment-intensive Yangtze River region, Hong Kong /Shenzhen-centered market-intensive pan Pearl River region, and information-intensive region of Beijing, but there are still no obvious functional features like the consulting clusters from Chicago, New York and Boston. The advantages of local consultancies are familiarity with local conditions, flexibilities, and low prices, but there are still several disadvantages of small scales, minor reputations, lacking of data banks and excellent talents. Are there any necessities for mutual learning and any ways for strategic alliances? The authors of the paper try to probe into the future co-existence of US and domestic consulting firms via perspectives between McKinsey & Co. and ZG Wang Strategic Consultancy in regional rail consulting programs of Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta. © 2005 IEEE.},

abstract={The research presented in this paper looks at evaluating RAMI4.0, a Research Architecture (RA) designed for Industry 4.0, through the representation of an existing Cyber-Physical System's (CPSs) key functionality. The use case represented is that of a UK firm refurbishing End of Life (EoL) IT devices for business clients. EoL refurbishment is a domain with many complexities due to an inherent business model which results in varying quantities, types and conditions of received devices. These uncertainties can generally not be addressed until the devices have arrived in the facility and are inspected. RAs are an important tool used in system development to represent functionality, this representation should be high level and allow the easy communication of key concepts for not only client-to-developers and developer-to-developer but also either to an audience. An appropriate RA will help industrialists to understand what Industry 4.0 means to them (i.e. increased flexibility and control) and the functionality of any system potentially being invested in. The results of this research included two proposals for the extension of RAMI4.0 regarding the representation of security and humans within the systems. While Industry 4.0 focusses on CPSs this work also makes a further recommendation that the focus of modelling should be shifted to Cyber-Physical Human Systems (CPHSs) to ensure correct consideration of the humans within the system. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Servitization and Industry 4.0 are considered two of the most recent trends transforming industrial companies. Servitization is mainly focused on adding value to the customer (demand-pull) while Industry 4.0 is frequently related to adding value to manufacturing process (technology-push). Although some scholars address them as complementary concepts, the literature lacks evidences about what are the interfaces and connection between the two trends. Thus, we aim to develop a conceptual framework that connects Servitization and Industry 4.0 concepts from a business model innovation (BMI) perspective. Our framework is based on three Servitization levels (i.e. smoothing, adapting and substituting) and three levels of digitization (i.e. low, moderate and high levels). We show that matching these levels results in nine possible configurations classified in manual, digital and industry 4.0-related services, which can focus on smoothing, adapting or substituting services. We use reported cases from the literature to support and illustrate these configurations. We also discuss different levels of complexity for the implementation of these configurations. The study hence provides a foundation for the growing research on the interface between Servitization and Industry 4.0. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The digital transformation of manufacturing (a phenomenon also known as "Industry 4.0" or "Smart Manufacturing") is finding a growing interest both at practitioner and academic levels, but is still in its infancy and needs deeper investigation. Even though current and potential advantages of digital manufacturing are remarkable, in terms of improved efficiency, sustainability, customization, and flexibility, only a limited number of companies has already developed ad hoc strategies necessary to achieve a superior performance. Through a systematic review, this study aims at assessing the current state of the art of the academic literature regarding the paradigm shift occurring in the manufacturing settings, in order to provide definitions as well as point out recurring patterns and gaps to be addressed by future research. For the literature search, the most representative keywords, strict criteria, and classification schemes based on authoritative reference studies were used. The final sample of 156 primary publications was analyzed through a systematic coding process to identify theoretical and methodological approaches, together with other significant elements. This analysis allowed a mapping of the literature based on clusters of critical themes to synthesize the developments of different research streams and provide the most representative picture of its current state. Research areas, insights, and gaps resulting from this analysis contributed to create a schematic research agenda, which clearly indicates the space for future evolutions of the state of knowledge in this field. © 2019 by the authors.

abstract={Due to the combination of vast technology trends brought by Industry 4.0, present-day consumers need and stiff global competition and require businesses from across many industries to constantly innovate. Clients request multifaceted support from manufacturers and service providers while the transition towards new symbiotic ecosystems disrupts traditionally established processes in some sectors. This is largely happening in the global automotive industry where in-car and around-the-car services with asset-sharing concepts are taking a dominant role rather than plain vehicles sales and car ownership. In our paper, we investigate the possibilities of new and improved business collaborations between a car retailer operating in several European countries and its SME (small and medium-sized enterprises) customers across various sectors currently owning car fleets of at least five vehicles. We test several hypotheses and conduct a systematic statistical analysis of the proposed business model's aspects on the sample of almost 200 SMEs from five countries in Southeast Europe. By using the Χ 2 test and a one-tailed t-test we tested both frequency data and the continuous variables. Research indicates that SMEs look for new ways to organize their fleet management strategy more efficiently and thus more precisely plan associated costs. Regardless of the country of origin, SMEs want to explore a business model with more introduced to their fleet management and are ready to accept new technologies for fleet management operations. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Driven by technological progress, the fourth revolution industry, called generic "digitization" or Industry 4.0, emerged as a necessity streamlining the increasingly complex production processes, to be able to meet global consumption needs. The Industrial Revolution 4.0 is characterized by convergence of the greatest technological advances, such as robotics, artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, virtual and augmented reality, printing multidimensional, transforming production processes and business models. Leading companies are no longer focusing on the trends specific to their own sector of activity, but they are connected to potential transformations and disturbances that can affect suppliers, customers and related markets. In Industry 4.0, competitive advantage is built in close collaboration with partners through a management effective change and an effective adaptation capacity the organization chart at the posts of the future as well as by investing in the new technologies. Romania is in a favourable position to adopt the change (internet speed, IT sector development, newest technology already in the facilities big production), but the leap towards digitization depends on flexibility and ability to quickly understand that the public and private sector is manifesting itself in relation to these profound transformations. The future of companies that will remain in the same paradigm of the traditional economic model is uncertain. The research aims to identify the most popular technologies on the market; as well as the attributes for an efficient digital adoption. The increase of digital adoption on Romania market is a reaction to favorable business environment and technologies availability.

abstract={The goal of this scientific study is to clarify and further specify Industry 4.0, to point out its possible social and economic consequences and to analyze Slovakia's state concept on Industry 4.0, called "Smart Industry for Slovakia". The focus of the research is on the current state of industrial development in Slovakia, with a cautious assessment of the consequences of digitization for the labor market in this country. A new aspect that will be fully developed in Industry 4.0 processes is to use new business models that will work on platforms within a collaborative economy. As a result of Industry 4.0 we can expect an increase in efficiency and productivity of the Slovak economy with unknown effects on the labor market and the income of the population.

abstract={Purpose: Industry 4.0 is expected to significantly transform industrial value creation. However, research on business models affected through Industry 4.0, and on small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), remains scarce. In response, the purpose of this paper is to address both aspects, further elaborating on the role that SMEs can take toward Industry 4.0 as provider or user. Design/methodology/approach: The paper used an exploratory research design based on 43 in-depth expert interviews within the three most important German industry sectors, mechanical and plant engineering, electrical engineering and automotive suppliers. Interviews were conducted with leading personnel of the respective enterprises, including 22 CEOs. They assign business model implications through Industry 4.0, referring to the Business Model Canvas, while the paper delineates between Industry 4.0 providers and users. Findings: The paper finds that key resources and value proposition are among the most affected elements of the business model, whereas channels are the least affected. Furthermore, distinct characteristics between Industry 4.0 providers and users can be delineated. In general, Industry 4.0 providers’ business models are significantly more affected than users, except for key partners and customer relationships. Research limitations/implications: Industry 4.0 remains at its early stages of implementation. As a result, many interviewees’ answers remain at a rather general level. Practical implications: Strategies for the further alignment of the business models are provided for Industry 4.0 providers and users. Originality/value: The paper is among the few that investigate Industry 4.0 in the context of SMEs and business models. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={A study of the management of the information infrastructure of a digital enterprise is conducted within the framework of the "Industry 4.0" concept. It is determined that modern digital technologies cause an exponential growth of data flows, for the effective functioning of which the need arises to transform a classic enterprise into digital. There are new business models, network structures based on collective methods of production and consumption, which transform traditional market relations and require the development of new solutions in the field of digital enterprise management. It is noted that the use of all elements (mobility; sociality; BPM, electronic document management system ERP finance and accounting; Big Data Analytics, business analytics) of modern information and communication technologies will increase the productivity and value of enterprises. It is determined that information and communication technologies allow to effectively interact with each other in certain sectors of production and ensure the optimization of any business processes using consumerization. Modern trends in the development of digital enterprises are identified and the prerequisites for the introduction of digitalization in the business space are marked. The constituent elements of the management process of the information infrastructure of a digital enterprise are structured, on the basis of which a model of the information infrastructure management process is proposed. The objectives of the digital infrastructure are substantiated, which are indicated: to increase the speed of decision-making, to increase the variability of processes depending on the needs and characteristics of the client, to reduce the number of employees involved in the process. The methodological foundations of the process of managing the information infrastructure of a digital enterprise are deepened in the context of the "Industry 4.0" concept. © 2019 Kateryna Andriushchenko, Volodymyr Rudyk, Olena Riabchenko, Maryana Kachynska, Nataliia Marynenko, Lidiya Shergina, Vita Kovtun, Mariia Tepliuk, Alla Zhemba, Oksana Kuchai.
Проведено дослідження процесу управ- ління інформаційною інфраструктурою цифрового підприємства в межах концепції «Індустрія 4.0». Визначено, що сучасні циф- рові технології викликають експоненціаль- не зростання потоків даних, для ефектив- ного функціонування яких постає питання трансформації класичного підприємства в цифрове. З'являються нові моделі веден- ня бізнесу, мережеві структури, що ґрун- туються на колективних методах вироб- ництва і споживання, трансформують традиційні ринкові відносини і вимагають вироблення нових рішень в галузі управлін- ня цифровим підприємством. Зазначено, що використання всіх елементів (мобільність; соціальність; BPM; система електронного документообігу; ERP фінанси та облік; Big Data & Analytics, бізнес-аналітика) сучас- них інформаційно-комунікаційних тех- нологій дозволить підвищити продуктив- ність та цінність підприємств. Визначено, що інформаційно-комунікаційні технології дозволяють ефективно взаємодіяти між собою в певних галузях виробництва та забезпечують оптимізацію будь-яких біз- нес-процесів за допомогою консьюмеріза- ції. Ідентифіковано сучасні тренди розвит- ку цифрового підприємства та окреслено передумови до впровадження цифровізації у бізнес-простір. Структуровано складові елементи процесу управління інформацій- ною інфраструктурою цифрового підпри- ємства, на базі чого запропоновано модель процесу управління інформаційною інфра- структурою. Обґрунтовано цілі цифрової інфраструктури, які зазначені: в підвищен- ні швидкості прийняття рішень, збільшен- ні варіативності процесів в залежності від потреб та особливостей клієнта, зниженні кількості залучених до процесу співробіт- ників. Поглиблено методичні основи проце- су управління інформаційною інфраструк- турою цифрового підприємства в умовах концепції «Індустрія 4.0».},

abstract={In the last century, the automotive industry has arguably transformed society, being one of the most complex, sophisticated, and technologically advanced industries, with innovations ranging from the hybrid, electric, and self-driving smart cars to the development of IoT-connected cars. Due to its complexity, it requires the involvement of many Industry 4.0 technologies, like robotics, advanced manufacturing systems, cyber-physical systems, or augmented reality. One of the latest technologies that can benefit the automotive industry is blockchain, which can enhance its data security, privacy, anonymity, traceability, accountability, integrity, robustness, transparency, trustworthiness, and authentication, as well as provide long-term sustainability and a higher operational efficiency to the whole industry. This review analyzes the great potential of applying blockchain technologies to the automotive industry emphasizing its cybersecurity features. Thus, the applicability of blockchain is evaluated after examining the state-of-the-art and devising the main stakeholders' current challenges. Furthermore, the article describes the most relevant use cases, since the broad adoption of blockchain unlocks a wide area of short- and medium-term promising automotive applications that can create new business models and even disrupt the car-sharing economy as we know it. Finally, after strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats analysis, some recommendations are enumerated with the aim of guiding researchers and companies in future cyber-resilient automotive industry developments. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={The Fourth Industrial Revolution is centered around a self-organized production. Cyber-physical systems can be used to collect and share data for tracking, automation and control as well as evaluation and documentation. This has a wide-reaching impact on business models. Instead of a linear approach, concentrating on a single company, the focus needs to be on the complete production ecosystem represented by a dynamic and self-organized network, including the supply chain. The interconnectedness of the cyber-physical systems in these networks is rooted in the Internet of Things, but also shared business processes. Performance, stability, security as well as data integrity and access control hereby represent a major contributing factor, calling for a new concept of information processing systems. The blockchain is a distributed ledger combining cryptographic and game-theoretic concepts, which enable immutable transactions and automatic consensus of the parties involved about its state. Blockchains have evolved as a fast-developing technology, promising increased efficiency and security in many scenarios, especially use cases that primarily rely on all kinds of transactions. The paper follows a design science approach, examining the implications of blockchain and the industrial Internet of Things in Industry 4.0 (I40) on supply chain management. I40’s implications on supply chains are discussed and connected with favorable characteristics of blockchain technology. Based on this analysis, requirements for a decentralized enterprise information processing system are derived, resulting in a reference model for distributed supply chains of I40. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

abstract={Industry 4.0 (I4.0) is changing business models and processes. I4.0 uses innovative trends such as Big Data, Cloud Computing, and Internet of things (IOT) to maximize economic benefits and return on investments. However, developing an I4.0 project may be costly, complex and risky for some companies. Therefore, careful requirements definition and mature Requirement Engineering (RE) processes are necessary. Undeveloped RE processes and poorly defined business requirements will often result in an inferior or a cancelled project. In addition, to ensure agility and allow for iterative changes in developing projects for I4.0, agile methodologies should be applied and prudently assessed. Unfortunately, most of existing assessment models are narrow focused and lack theoretical foundation and proper validation. This research proposes a comprehensive maturity framework called agile Requirement Engineering Maturity Model for Industry 4.0 (ARE-MMI4.0). The framework provides assessment of the minimum maturity levels to start a project for I4.0. The framework integrates an I4.0 maturity model with RE and agile maturity models to ensure the ultimate maturity assessment for the business processes. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Industry 4.0 is the conceptual era where Internet and digital technology becomes an enabler for innovation and transformation. Digital transformations are required by Telecommunication firms to transform their portfolio beyond the pipeline to close the gap in business model innovations, redefine customer engagement and co-creation, and set up new distinctive organization capabilities. This paper has the objective to develop a digital transformation model by assessing the mediating role of co-creation strategy on the relationship between distinctive organizational capability and business model innovation. The units of analysis are Indonesian telecommunication firms, using a sample of 35 out of 445 telecommunication firms. The analytical approach used for analysis is Smart Partial Least Square (PLS). The study results reveal that distinctive organizational capability has an indirect effect on business model innovation, but direct effect to co-creation strategy. © 2018, Czestochowa University of Technology.

abstract={Continuing digitalization on the way to industry 4.0 opens up a number of new opportunities for pulp and paper manufacturers and converters. Options range from process optimization to the establishment of new value creation networks and business models. Even skeptical entrepreneurs will have to face these facts if they want to remain competitive. Paper industry managers find themselves confronted with the problem of finding optimal solution concepts that will sustainably ensure business success. However, significant expenditure and the need for a high level of resources constitute a major stumbling block for many companies on their path to the fourth industrial transition. BTG Process Solutions experts specialize in the implementation of solution concepts that give high initial benefits at low resource requirements, thus providing a solid basis for an efficient approach to Industry 4.0. This is illustrated by a number of examples from industrial practice including the optimization of a pulp bleach plant, the implementation of a prediction model on a paperboard machine and the Vigilance 4.0 concept applied to the operation of a Yankee cylinder for tissue manufacture. © 2018 Deutscher Fachverlag GmbH.

abstract={This paper is addresses the question, whether the steel industry will be able to generate substantial, additional business volume with digital business models (like Apple or Google) or whether it is just chasing a ghost. Criteria for successful innovation in the steel industry in the 20th century, as well as in the digital 21st century, are analyzed and compared. The author concludes that digitalization will form the 6th Kondratieff cycle, but that, regarding digitalization and Industry 4.0, the steel industry differs substantially from other industries (e.g. automotive). According to the author, it will be decisive and critical whether the steel industry will be able to attract a sufficient number of Industry 4.0 engineers in the future. © Verlag Stahleisen GmbH.

abstract={With the concept of Industry 4.0 spreading, smart manufacturing is going to work in a brand new production process, in which a number of technologies are integrated, including cyber-physical systems, the Internet of Things, and the Internet of Services, to facilitate a new business model of 'smart manufacturing and service'. The key to an intelligent automation system is the capability of software/hardware system integration regarding various equipments and controllers, where response time of the equipment plays an important role. However, in an industrial transmission network, the hardware specification of the receiver is probably not good enough, so that the processor in the receiver may be unable to process multiple requests simultaneously. This paper proposes a method for scheduling multiple periodic requests. This method can reduce the burden on the device when the device is high loading in order to maintain the effective operation of the device. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Industry 4.0 is characterized by intensive digitization of production and equipping the machines with a high use of ICT (information and communication technology. However, the fourth industrial revolution brings with it more security-related challenges. It is important to engineer, industrial solutions that design, build and run Industry 4.0-systems securely, reliably and effectively. Moreover, industrial systems are designed according to the new characteristics enabling connecting and interacting with other Industry 4.0-systems in a reliable manner. Furthermore, it is essential to consider the new innovative business models by designing these systems. The digital data and knowhow in companies are the most valuable assets and thus should be protected. This data are the new trade ware by many businesses and add new values to companies. In this paper, one of these models that are based on online-trading of technology data, is considered. Technology data are defined as machine's functioning parameters that are required to ensure a smooth operation of machines under different circumstances. The focus is to develop an Industry 4.0-capable machine with the new characteristics that an Industry 4.0-system have. The security concepts for protecting the technology data by designing and manufacturing the machine will be validated by means of a use case of participating in a technology data marketplace. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={The evolution of the world of energy towards a system of decentralized production and consumption assets makes it possible to understand better the upcoming industrial revolution, which will be one of distributed information flows. A new paradigm, the 'blockchain', enables economic actors to completely decentralize information flows without intermediaries. Even though many technological locks still exist today, it becomes possible already today to imagine that each machine or connected object will be able to communicate autonomously and securely with others, learn and enrich its mode of operation thanks to artificial intelligence technologies. The business models will be strongly impacted by a greater flexibility of the manufacturing capacities, their adaptation in real time to consumer constraints and the optimization of supply management (raw material, energy and components) through smart purchase, onsite production, 3D-printing and smart logistics: A fractal production with shorter supply channels steered by resources and energy efficiency data. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Digitization of business processes is changing the industry. Enterprises using data as efficiently and smart as possible, can often create a clear competitive advantage and be more responsive to their customer needs. Through the smart use of data, new business models can be created. The most well-known changes of digitization are taking place in the B2C market. The B2B market is affected by this change too. Enterprises recognize the ongoing shift to a service-oriented society and therefore should be able to react directly to the customer needs. Service based business models, such as implementing Smart Services, are developed and intergarted in existing enterprise offerings. This paper reports upon a study of the maturity level regarding Smart Services of three selected German enterprises. The aim is to highlight the the impact of the ongoing digital transformation and map the maturity levels with regards to digitization and Smart Services. The case studies offer a first assessment about the current situation of Smart Services, using sub-categories to pinpoint developments, in manufacturing enterprises. The analysis shows that the maturity levels of these enterprises depend on their technology management, financial resources and corporate culture. The three cases have a high maturity level and already implemented Smart Services in their business model strategy. Nevertheless, there is still potential for improvement, especially regarding 'Simultaneous Engineering' and 'Automation Level'. It can be stated that within these enterprises financial resources, critical awareness as well as know-how of digitization and Smart Services are available. The cases were organizationally rather set in rigid structures. In order to reach an even higher degree of maturity and thus to remain competitive in the future, the enterprises should fundamentally rethink their corporate culture. These case studies may be considered as a pilot study into this topic, with refinements and improvements to further studies possible. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Industry 4.0 is a polarizing subject, affecting industries transnationally since 2011. To determine the state of Industry 4.0 across French companies in 2018, a pilot study was carried out dealing with six Industry 4.0 dimensions: Product Development Process, Steering Control, Manufacturing Operations, Smart Services, Big Data, and Organization Structure. Specialist knowledge and implementation of advanced technology in all dimensions is prerequisite to achieve a high standard in Industry 4.0. Beyond that, the interconnection and the integration of all elements along the value chain is crucial. Combined with the existing literature on these dimensions, the researchers assess and describe the current state and the existing challenges. The focus of the survey was to get insights in the activities of French companies towards Industry 4.0, and thereby assessing their state in each dimension. Good approaches were considered, but there is a lack of knowledge about the extensive aspects and the significance of Industry 4.0. Especially in cases, where Industry 4.0 technologies enable new business models such as Big Data or Smart Services, the knowledge is limited. Best known and partially implemented are elements in Product Development and Production. However, there is a lack of understanding for the key aspect across all interviewed companies; the integration of various objects in the value chain. The six dimensions cannot be treated separately, neither in theory nor in practice. It has become abundantly clear that there is room for improvement, and that Industry 4.0 is a highly relevant topic the companies need to confront in-depth and in detail. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={The advent of the Fourth Industry Revolution calls for companies to radically rethink existing business models and innovate business models through detailed and consistent strategies. In this study, three types of business model frameworks are presented as methods to cope with the Fourth Industrial Revolution at the enterprise level. We also have designed business model frameworks that utilizes four axes; hyper-connectivity, hyper-intelligence, hyper-convergence, and hyper-predictability. And then, we finally suggest a framework of smart connected business model. This model uses information and communication technology to create an online and offline platform, enhances the connectivity of human beings, objects and markets, and analyzes and utilizes the data generated here. It is a circulation structure that develops existing products (or services), market, and business models, which create prediction, customization, and innovation. © 2018, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

abstract={Ongoing technological development pushes industry towards the so called fourth industrial revolution. Considering new technology as a determinant of future business environment, we find it necessary to examine how platforms such as Industry 4.0 will change enterprises organization and business models. Designed model should serve as guidance for new and also already existing enterprises for implementing of Industry 4.0 required attributes especially in early stage. Main emphasis is given on software and cloud solutions that will become necessary despite the fact that in recent industrial SMEs they do not play significant role. Such transformation will raise crucial questions about funding new technologies. © 2018 Leos Safar et al.},

abstract={Early warning systems are becoming increasingly important in high-risk industries, because of their potential to detect all kinds of subtle threats and opportunities, that is, weak signals, in order to avoid strategic surprises. However, it is an under-researched area within the context of smart factories. For the purpose of the study, semi-structured group interviews were used to investigate how managers at a smart factory, a highly innovative global supplier in the automotive industry sense weak signals, perceive the role of intuition, smart systems and business model adjustments. The results of the study show that managers perceive early warning systems as highly important for timely response to development changes and that both smart systems and intuition play an essential role in detecting and responding to weak signals. Based on this study, we propose a managerial early warning system model with four stages, namely, identifying, screening, appraising and responding to weak signs, within the context of a smart factory. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={The transport system is an important sector in economies, both in terms of its own share of gross national product and in its role as a presupplier, prime location and facilitator of private and occupational mobility. Like other industries, the transport system is subject to changes in technological trends, especially with regards to digitalisation. When analysing the forms and effects of digitalisation, one may be overwhelmed by the multitude of terms, such as: Industry 4.0, Physical Internet, Internet of Things, Radical Innovation, New Business Models and Digital Transformation. These terms are often interpreted in different ways because they have been specifically designed for agenda setting and thus for the enforcement of the individual interests of consultants, researchers and industries. And while transport has high hopes for digitalisation, it doesn’t necessarily apply to all parameters of the transport system. There are several relevant issues to consider including the extent to which digitalisation affects the traffic supply and demand and whether this will lead to an increase or decrease in traffic movements. © 2018, Springer Verlag.

abstract={The traditional manufacturing business model is changing for new emerging models. Many changes are related to the industry 4.0 challenge and among them there is a concern regarding how industries will meet the objectives of sustainable operations, especially on that of environmental protection and process safety. Some industries are making great efforts to get aligned with the industry 4.0 paradigm, and for the Electric System Industry, it is no different. Because of its strategic and environmental importance, the electric system industry must be investigated. In this article we used qualitative research based on a systemic approach, using the Soft System Methodology (SSM) to address the challenges brought by the industry 4.0 paradigm in the electric system industry in Brazil, focusing on the topic of environmental protection and process safety. Moreover, we point out important capabilities needed by these companies to keep up with the new industrial revolution. Results from the SSM have exposed important management gaps and hence have shown new possible management models that can contribute to the modernization of the electric utilities in Brazil, making these industries more sustainable. In fact, it is imperative for companies to detail the organizational capabilities they will need to thrive in the business process. Therefore, we conclude the paper by indicating the three main dynamic capabilities that have emerged: new policies to enable innovation, bureaucracy reduction, and investments in education. © 2018},

abstract={In this paper, the author analyses the significant influence of IT on global megatrends. Of the five leading global megatrends, two are in the field of ICT, digital media and new technologies. The main reasons for the impact of IT megatrends are twofold: (1) the digital convergence of the media, ICT and telecommunications industries, (2)the exponential increase in information, computing power and internet transfer data. Digital convergence will significantly contribute to changing business models. In an applicative sense, the author considers the concepts of Industry 4.0 - The Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR), to be the most significant as it marks the paradigmatic change of information, the conceptual and processual transformation of data and services ecosystems in the domains of robotics, the Internet of Things (IoT), Internet of Services, Automated Intelligence, Collaborative Robots (Cobots), Industrial Robots, Augmented Reality, and Virtual Reality. In business and strategic terms, digital media business models will transition, under the influence of digital convergence, to a multiplatform, complementary, interoperable and networked media and ICT ecosystem with a specific focus on the production and distribution of media products, services and applications within the user interface, hypermedia, immersion, mass customization, personalized, augmented and ambient media business space and environment. © 2018 Croatian Communicologysts Association.

abstract={Nowadays Enterprises are pursuing Digital Transformation to build a new business model and internal processes. Cloud Computing, Big Data, Mobile and Social are top subject and the direction is how to integrate their legacy process and make a convergence to new model. AI and Deep learning technology are rapidly emerged and becoming really critical of new solutions and the solution definitely uses cloud platform by API services and Pre-built assets. It drives API economy growth by global service providers' platform services. API Economy generates a lot of application diversity and platform provides the services, which can support Digital Transformation. Once they build their platform by themselves or 3rd party platform services, they should think about the expansion of their business via the collaboration of business partners. This collaboration model is ecosystem generation to build new partnership. By providing services to business partners they can expand customer who are dealing with business partners. The collaboration of platform service with business partner and the customer will be the new way of enterprise revolution as a part of the 4th industrial revolution. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Industry 4.0 will be the most powerful driver of innovation over the next few decades, innovation being the move towards sustainable competitiveness and profitable growth [1]. The research underpins the earlier research in methodological terms and traces successful performance such as productivity and quality results of an SME (small and medium-sized enterprise) within the context of Industry 4.0. This new industrial paradigm is not just about technology, but it also involves changes in the technical and production development, so current ways of value creation are evolving and bringing extensive organizational consequences and opportunities. Our case study presents the systematic diversification process described in the Maturity Model to implement Industry 4.0 scenario [2] in an automotive production company, using the three elements: Envision, Enable and Enact. We choose to present this case study because many companies want to start the implementation of this new business model. However, there is a gap of information concerning the steps that a small and medium production unit needs to make in order to change the strategy of the company regarding the Industry 4.0. All the above affect directly the productivity results without negative effects on the quality results of the analysed company. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Cyber physical systems offer a vast variety of new possibilities in the context of the fourth industrial revolution, ‘Industrie 4.0’. Due to an increasing amount of more complex requirements for companies and the necessity of an implementation guideline of Industrie 4.0 technologies, a new approach for supporting small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) was developed: the 'Generic Procedure Model to Introduce Industrie 4.0' (GPMI4.0). Fields of action, adapted to their own enterprise, are identified to reach a higher level of Industrie 4.0. GPMI4.0s core method is the Industrie 4.0 toolbox which is divided in five phases: preparation, analysis, idea generation, validation and implementation. Toolboxes for the domain product, production, intralogistics, IT security and assembly are already published. However, in order to use technologies of Industrie 4.0 in more stages of the product life cycle, GPMI4.0 has to be applied to the not yet considered domain of engineering. This paper focuses on the development of a Toolbox for the domain of engineering regarding Industrie 4.0, analysing the product development process from the product idea to the manufacturing process. Using the Toolbox, the enterprises are able to analyse their engineering in the context of Industrie 4.0 and develop solutions to reach a higher level. The purpose of the engineering Toolbox is to generate an engineering competence profile by classifying the development state of every application level of an enterprise. Based on the profile the engineering Toolbox is used to advance the enterprise engineering competence regarding Industrie 4.0. The benefits are optimized inputs for the production field that can be used for the digital supply chain and for generating new business models. Finally, the suitability of the engineering Toolbox is validated by different companies and projects. © 2018 Newswood Limited. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In the era of the 4th industrial revolution, the worldwide blockchain market is forecasted to grow more than 10 times in the next five years and blockchain-based information sharing platform technology is expected to become an important infrastructure technology of high utilization value across all industries. However, clearly, blockchain has limitations that need to be solved and because it is still in the early development stage, the active advancement of the technology is developer-oriented; further,it is necessary to implement policies proactively to secure an early competitive edge at the national level. A blockchain facilitates trust-based information sharing through decentralization, but all information in a blockchain is open and permanently stored. Because of this, it is difficult to modify or erase data recorded in a blockchain; furthermore, the “right to be forgotten” cannot be guaranteed, which is important for maintaining privacy. If private information and sensitive information can only be stored permanently and cannot be erased, Blockchain cannot become a realistic business model in the information society where information protection is of the highest priority. In this paper, the technical and political limitations of the permanent storage characteristic of blockchain, which cannot be modified or deleted, are analyzed and the on-chain that stores metadata and the off-chain that stores full data are linked with hyperlinks. Moreover, technical and political approaches are proposed to implement the erasable blockchain technology of the hyperlink method, which facilitates modification and erasure of on-chain metadata, and the kill-button method, which changes a block’s data into an unusable state. © 2018, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc..

abstract={If finance enables production, technology in the financial services sector enhances the speed of accessing and transferring finances, ultimately facilitating more production. Accepting new technologies is therefore crucial to the success of any industry in the fourth industrial revolution. Technologies such as Social Media, Mobile, Analytics (and Big Data), Cloud, along with the Internet of Things (SMACT/SMACIT), have become pervasive digital disruptors which have fundamentally changed the business models and value propositions of firms across industries. The financial services sector has been disrupted by innovations such as M-Pesa, SnapScan and EcoCash, which have made it more inclusive. The growing smartphone uptake in South Africa and developing countries has removed barriers to financial services provision and has reduced barriers to information access. SMACT technologies offer an opportunity for the financial services sector to reduce the costs of banking in such a way that those who are underserved or unserved by the financial services sector are more informed and better able to access financial services through the removal of geographic barriers to banking and through the reduction of costs. Chigada and Hirschfelder (2017:3) state that the integration of the banking system is part of the critical functions of mobile banking. Lower-income classes, despite having individually weaker purchasing power, actually have astoundingly significant purchasing power at the collective level (Chigada & Hirschfelder, 2017:3). Mobile banking therefore seeks to integrate into the banking system this poor yet large population who collectively possess significant market power. In order to integrate the poor into the financial services sector, the benefits of mobile banking have to be conveyed to them in a way that clearly indicates simplicity and convenience (Ramavhona & Mokwena, 2010:5; Al-Jabri & Sohail, 2012:387; Ernst & Young, 2016:6). This paper aims to assess the digital disruption from big data of the South African financial services sector with a particular focus on financial inclusion. The study used a mixed method approach. For the qualitative method, data was collected from semi-structured interviews with key informants from the financial services sector and related fields of expertise. © 2018 Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

abstract={There is a growing interest in the pay-per-outcome business models in manufacturing industries because of novel technologies provided by Industry 4.0 implementations. These business models for the software companies cannot be directly applied for manufacturing companies because of the scalability issues as well as complexity issues. The purpose of this paper is to identify perceived benefits and risks of Industry 4.0 enabled pay-per-outcome models for manufacturing companies (machine builders). We conducted qualitative interviews of machine building companies. We identified and selected companies that have been experimenting with novel Industry 4.0 enabled pay-per-outcome business models. We were able to create understanding the perceived benefits and risks of these advanced industry 4.0 enabled PPU/PPO type business models for machine builders. Since there is a limited amount of practical implications especially in case of investment heavy machine builders thus there is little understanding about related benefits and risks of implementing these novel Industry 4.0 enabled pay-per-outcome business models. This study can facilitate decision making of managers about implementing these novel business models by taking into account the expected benefits as well as bottlenecks encountered. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2018.},

abstract={The socio-economic trends in the last decades (population growth, rapid industrialization and urbanization) have accelerated the transition from the old linear material flow to the more sustainable circular economy (CE). CE is recognized as a clear value creation opportunity, which can bring the lasting benefits of a more innovative, resilient and productive economy. Nevertheless, there is a huge gap between the big concept of CE and the practical actions. In particular, the research and the implementation of circular models to date have mainly focused on the product end-of-life, in order to reduce, reuse and recycle waste, but the lack of feedback information and performance indexes does not allow the measurement of how a product, a process or a company is really transiting from linear to circular models. This critical issue limits the further development of other circular activities. The impending digital transformation within the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution’ can support CE to provide these missing aspects. Starting from the consolidated CE model, the paper describes how the application of intelligent assets, Internet-of-Things and big data, could be the basis to create a more promising circular model, where CE principles are extended to the entire product life-cycle, from product design to product utilization, considering also production assets and business strategies. Some case studies, described in literature, are presented to demonstrate how smart assets can interact with circular economy to create a new and more productive model of CE, characterized by a complete and effective circular platform for materials, products, assets and processes, where information and indicators are collected to measure circular efficiency. © 2018 AIDI - Italian Association of Industrial Operations Professors.

abstract={This study is devoted to the existing and future information technology that forms a base for concepts of Industry 4.0 and cyber-physical systems using examples of firms that apply this technology. Examples include manufacturing and transportation companies. The objective of this paper is to analyse the impact of intelligent information technologies in Industry 4.0 and cyber-physical systems on the enterprise management principles in near future. The transformation trends are illustrated on case-study examples. The literature and case-study analysis shows that enterprise management in manufacturing and transportation lacks understanding of Industry 4.0 and cyber-physical systems in terms of application to concrete business models. The reviews cases lead to the conclusion that the Industry 4.0 and cyber-physical technology applications are rather contextual and engineering-oriented. The implementation of the main principle of the Industry 4.0 and cyber-physical technology, i.e., the self-organisation and self-adaption of dynamic networked structures along the entire product lifecycle to ensure the flexible individual manufacturing at the mass production costs, has been yet applied very restrictively and mostly in research projects. The paper presents an original interpretation of the serviceoriented approach to modeling and solution of the information technology assessment and selection problems to facilitate a broader application in firms. This approach is based on the structural dynamics control theory developed by the authors. © 2018 St. Petersburg Institute for Informatics and Automation of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

abstract={This paper investigates the impact of the three mega-trends (1) digitalisation (2) sustainability and (3) servitisation on design and development capabilities in manufacturing companies. First, technological advancements have created both product opportunities, and new aids, captured in e.g. the Industry 4.0 paradigm, and intensively driving digitalisation of businesses, that, besides the technological challenges, cause new challenges and problem areas, such as information ownership and shared long-term responsibilities. Second, the need for sustainable solutions increases the focus on the design of circular, resource efficient and radically new technological solutions to be designed with a total life cycle perspective in mind, through use phase, repair and overhaul, until recycling and end-of-life. Third, and finally, the classical roles for suppliers, integrators and users are being changed as servitisation and Product-Service Systems (PSS) offerings affect both products and businesses, and ultimately entire value networks with new constellations of business partners contributing to the realization of solutions for customers. This paper builds on a conceptual literature review to identify relevant information about the three trends regarding their impact on design and societal development. In addition, a semi-structured interview study was conducted to investigate possibilities and challenges that four different types of manufacturing companies perceive today with respect to the mega-trends, and more specifically how these trends impact the design and development capabilities in the studied companies. Results from this empirical study show that digitalisation is viewed as an opportunity to find new solutions to meet customer needs and be competitive at the future market. Sustainable Product Development (SPD) was instead primarily to fulfil requirements and legislation. However, it was clear that some manufacturers start to see market forces as a driver. PSS can be seen as a means to create new solutions, often with digital tools as facilitator. Altogether, the literature study and the empirical data show that increasingly, designers are expected to design entire solutions, as opposed to merely artefacts. This implies that designers need to consider not only the product performance and cost, but products' and solutions' behaviour and impact over complete life cycles, developed and organized by business networks together with several suppliers and other partners with different capabilities. The basis for the designer is a technology mix comprising services, software, electronics and hardware, bundled into offerings in new business models, interlinked with new digital opportunities. Moreover, it is clear that the three trends do not represent stand-alone perspectives but affect one another in an intertwined way. To achieve long-term effects, the sustainability issues need to be integrated with many other subject areas, and implemented simultaneously as digital solutions, e.g. digital twins to physical artefacts are conceived, and value creating networks are being built up. Obviously, these three trends affect the need for change in product design capabilities and escalate the challenges of the integrated product development viewpoint, in a way that is difficult to master for individual engineers. Support for design and development work is needed that takes into account the mega-trends digitalisation, sustainability, and servitisation. © Proceedings of NordDesign: Design in the Era of Digitalization, NordDesign 2018.

abstract={The development of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) has induced large structural changes in societies, whose success is now associated with gaining and distributing knowledge. The concept of lifelong education has become one of the main principles of educational institutions around the world. The traditional ways of gaining and distributing knowledge have become insufficient and rigid, and in some cases of poor qualfiity CP. This is particularly true for the special as well as highly interdisciplinary knowledge and competences needed for interdisciplinary studies, such as Wood Science and Technology. Digitalisation of the educational process, the use of modern ICT and introduction via e-learning are some of the possible solutions to these problems. Additionally, they are all part of the concept of Industry 4.0, the implementation of which is the key to the development of the wood sector in Slovenia. New technologies and learning methods will stimulate the development of business models (e.g. virtualisation technologies in the sales/marketing process) in the wood industry, which will have a positive impact on the development of the whole wood sector and consequently increase demand for wood products. The goal of the research is to examine the best practices and technologies for digitalisation of education and to analyze the use of e-learning approaches and technologies in the higher education context of wood science in Slovenia. © 2018 Increasing the Use of Wood in the Global Bio-Economy - Proceedings of Scientific Papers.

abstract={Technology will change the way people perform work and impact the operating model of organisations. Bhalla, Dyrcks and Strack (2017) states: “a tidal way of change is coming that will soon make the way we work almost unrecognizable to today’s business leaders. In an age of rapidly evolving technologies, business models, demographics, and even workplace attitudes – all shifting concurrently – change is not only constant but also exponential in its pace and scope.” These changes result from the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) and its emphasis on technological innovation and digital productivity in organisations. Traditionally, all managerial and operational areas in organisations have been enabled and supported by knowledge management (KM) in the form of a codification or personalisation strategy. However, in the 4IR organisation it is acknowledged that “knowledge” will be in the form of “big data” which is received by sensors and transmitted to actuators and can be analysed in a cloud-based cyber-physical system. This requires re-conceptualisation on the relevance of knowledge management in supporting the functional areas of organisations as well as the manner in which knowledge management manifests. More importantly on the applicability and relevancy of knowledge management in an age where humans are seamlessly connected through ubiquitous technologies. What will the role of knowledge management be in organisations and societies where humans will become redundant because of the ability of machines to perform both repetitive but also highly complex work? It is evident that the manifestation of knowledge management will change radically in 4IR organisations. Change is imminent and knowledge management needs to evolve or subside into a cyber-physical realm. Hence, a literature review and three case studies reflect on the interrelationship between technology and knowledge management within the context of the 4IR organisation. © 2018 Academic Conferences Limited.},

abstract={The merging of services and digital technologies generates remarkable opportunities in manufacturing, by allowing more efficient processes, adding value to products, and supporting improved managerial decisions with richer, faster and sounder information. Although the importance of this phenomenon, the scientific knowledge is not sufficient. By analyzing the emerging trends of digitization and servitization in manufacturing we tried firstly to identify the key digital technologies to the servitization by studying different frameworks and the national industry 4.0 policy initiatives in Europe. Secondly to describe and explain if and how they enable this transformation. This paper aims specifically to provide a framework which is able to rationalize and systemize the existing knowledge on the topic by conducting a literature review. This study is considered as the first step of a research program on how these two megatrends are jointly disrupting resources, competences, skills and consequently business models. We show that the knowledge about how digital technologies support servitization in manufacturing is still at an early stage and rather limited so future research should aim at better understanding the links between digital and service transformation. Greater knowledge of the impacts of digital technologies on the servitization process will pave the way for the development of contingency models that can support and guide academics and practitioners alike. © 2018 The Authors.

abstract={Healthcare organizations are currently in an era of significant digital transformation. Organizations are seeking to adapt within a globalized environment with ever-increasing complexity of care and regulatory requirements. To be successful in this new era, organizations must re-envision their value chain to improve patient outcomes, and be flexible and adaptable in their ability to respond to the competitive marketplace. The combination of traditional production and cyber-physical production will indicate the evolution from traditional business models to the emerging non-linear value chains. The aim of this paper is to review the healthcare value chain in the context of digitally-enabled technologies such as hyperledger and blockchain, which have the potential to extensively alter healthcare organizations. The research contributions include development of a reusable hyperchain artifact, construct development, and understanding the shift from the traditional healthcare value chain to the industry 4.0 digital healthcare value chain model instantiation of the hyperchain. © 2018 Association for Information Systems.

abstract={We are currently on the marks of Industry 4.0. Characterized by increased digitalization and automation, it is expected to overturn traditional business models and supply chains. Industry 4.0 initiatives have already made significant impact on industry, and will continue to do so in the years to come. While the concept of Industry 4.0 gains a foothold, there is no clear idea of how it should be addressed by companies. The transformation is without a doubt a strategic imperative that requires long-term commitment. Instead of investing in new technologies in an ad hoc manner, companies need to adopt a systematic approach to address technological opportunities throughout the supply chain. There exist many different and, in some cases, conflicting opinions about the scope of such an approach, what it should contain, its point of departure, etc. This paper synthesizes such views into a framework that depicts the strategic landscape manufacturing companies are facing at the outset of their digital journey. The framework can be used to position and discuss companies’ digitalization and automation initiatives with respect to business-, manufacturing-, supply chain-, and digital strategy. © 2018, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

abstract={The article emphasizes the relevance of the digital economy development as one of the most important directions of the fourth industrial revolution. It is significant for a breakthrough in science and technology, social and economic development. I prove that the industrial policy is a reliable instrument for supporting digital economy. The following factors define the priorities of industrial policy: the level of socio-economic development of the country, the existing model of economic development, an image of the country's future. I consider the evolution of the industrial policy priorities in Russia. In current situation, the essentially new priority is the support of digital economy. I find that pro-active digital economy formulation and management in collaboration of all branches of the government as well as the development of digital economy together with sector programmes and programmes of innovative development, etc. are of great importance. I have suggested steps, which could make the Industry Development Fund to support the new priorities connected with digital economy development. Furthermore, I have developed proposals on adjusting provisions, which define the possibility to apply special investment contracts for stimulating the digital economy development. I have defined the main directions of staffing the digital economy. The article emphasizes that «digital transformation of the industry» radically changes the idea targets and subjects of industrial policy. So-called related industries, as the association of goods, individuals, and technologies within the industrial system, the structures based on such special type of business models as technological platforms and the human needs become a new targets of the industrial policy. During the fourth industrial revolution, a system of interaction between federal and regional authorities and various business associations as well as civil society institutions becomes the main subject of industrial policy. This predetermines a multi-actor character of the industrial policy. The requirements to leaders of the state and business structures have increased. Therefore, their responsibility for preventing negative social and ethical consequences of the implementation of new technology solutions. © 2018 Economy of Region. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The fourth Industrial Revolution is opening unprecedented opportunities to solve some of the hardest social problems and, in the process, make significant business gains, However, scaling up these new solutions is not easy. Leading businesses will need to reinvent the way they do business to capture these opportunities, including addressing the risks and challenges posed by new technologies. The essential components of scaling up the new business model include being good at orchestrating an innovation ecosystem, defining the guiding principles to harness the collective intelligence of all the ecosystem players, and devising a methodology for successful execution from development and design to sustainable operations.

abstract={The article proves that the industrial policy is not only an element coordinating the various types of state policies. It is as well a platform, on which the economic policy of the state is built. I systematize five directions representing the traditional approach to understanding the industrial policy and three new directions of its understanding. I emphasize that a new purpose of the industrial policy as the achievement of «an image» of a “good economy”, and that the «standard projects» of regional industrial policy are unacceptable. I define new characteristics of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Its fundamental features are harmonization and integration of a large amount of research disciplines. This, in turn, imposes high requirements to developing priorities for both the federal and regional industrial policy. Another feature of the Fourth Industrial Revolution is the emergence of the digital economy. I analyse its development in Russia as compared with the developed countries. Moreover, I systemize the studies about the readiness of Russian companies for the digital economy. The information and communication technologies are the most important factor for the digital economy. The analysis of these technologies development in regions showed high level of its differentiation of regional indicators (from 1.5 to more than 300 times). The assessment of the development of information and communication technologies allow categorise the Middle Urals as a leading region almost for all indicators in this area not only in the Ural Federal District, but also in Russia, in general. The importance of new business models as most essential innovations during the Fourth Industrial Revolution has increased. This defines new agents and objects of industrial policy. The results of the research may be used to correct the regional strategy of socio-economic development as well as laws on industrial policy. © 2018 Institute of Economics, Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

abstract={Since 3D printing technology has been available as early as in the early 19th century, the present article start from the question why this radical and probably disruptive technology has been observed as only incremental innovation for so long a time. In answering this question, we assume that this incrementalisation of the supposed key to the next industrial revolution occurred due to circumstances that complicated and complexed the observation, with the most important of which being that 3D printers do not print on the medium, but rather print the medium, which emerges as form. In this article, this paradox is unfolded in the form of a form-theoretical theory statement on the inherently paradox nature of observation, subsequent to which 3D printing can be observed as both form and medium. In exploring this paradox, we will show that suppliers of 3D printing solutions currently try to sell 3D printing as form, whereas demanders observe 3D printing as medium. In focusing the latter side of the distinction, we finally suggest that the key to successful 3D printing business models will be in solutions that relate observations of the technological multifunctionality of 3D printing to a social multifunctionality lens.

abstract={Along with the fourth Industrial Revolution, the manufacturing industry is pursuing the differentiation from the previous manufacturing system, seeking profit via not only producing the goods but also servitizing the products. However, there are rare cases that customer oriented service is developed and provided by integrating the product and the service to provide the maximum utility to customers, in a situation where new services, such as Internet of Things(IoT), are created by connecting tangible and intangible objects. This study tried to find the innovative direction for manufacturing by developing smart plug with networking function using service design approach. At discovery phase, business model canvas was used to clarify the smart plug business environment, and at definition phase, total 14 service concepts were drawn to provide the direction of service. Also, 32 scenarios were created to expend service concept to various forms at the development phase, and lastly, at delivery phase, 10 smart plug services that will be feasible in near future were proposed.

abstract={Economists believe that we are entering the Post-Information Age, which is expected to succeed the current Information Age as the principal engine of economic activity. In this paper the authors assess this statement and how this impacts Information and Communications Technology (ICT)'s approach to meeting the needs of the digital transformation in business and society. The demands of systems such as 1) the Internet of Things (IoT), especially sensor networks and their deployment 2) 'Industry 4.0' and its competitiveness 3) the application of intelligent technologies to the major infrastructures (big cities, ports, airports, energy grids, etc.), will not be delivered through small projects but rather will be built around complex partnerships and ecosystems. Moving from this assessment, the authors look more closely also at the means of constructing a business case for new communications solutions, noting that the Post-Information Age will create new opportunities for Network Service Providers (NSPs). In doing this, they will examine key differences in the way offerings are constructed for the whole market sector, from consumer to major corporate / central Government solutions. According to the results found, it looks as if the same techniques apply to all segments, but with different weights and different approaches to the construction of key parameters for the specific value-proposition. The authors are strongly convinced that modelling the business case, partnership options and ecosystems remain the most powerful tools in assessing digital service viability. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Although that Cloud infrastructures are nowadays available, there is a lack ofadoption by companies. While big companies with large computing devisionsadopted the Cloud paradigm, small and midsize enterprises (SME) with a limitednumber of computer experts were scared by the complexity of the technology and by the huge investement to move to Cloud. But even for SMEs, the migration to Cloud infrastructure and the consequent usage of Open Sourcetechnology build the basement for future-proof IT systems in the era of theInternet-of-Things and Industry 4.0. At the same time, the business models ofsmall companies in the handcraft sector like carpentry are changing too. Although their customers require personalized and sustainable products, theproduction is using more industrial like technologies and processes. TheAQUASI project builds currently framework for SMEs using Open Source technology based on existing OSGi components to enable these companies to migrate their IT systems to the Cloud, to improve the communication and production processbetween collaborating partners, to collect data from IoT-sensorsfor further data analysis and by providing an analytical system to guaranteequality of sustainable products for more than 10 decades. This paper presentsthe overall architecture of the AQUASI system including a fine-grained serviceand communication model for Industry 4.0 projects. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Consumer electronics industry is a century old, but never in its history was it undergoing such a fundamental change as now. The devices use Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to become connected and smart. The next stage is to use the astonishing advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) to make the devices intelligent. This digital fourth industrial revolution creates tremendous opportunities but also pitfalls. There is a need for a clear model of the intelligent consumer electronics technology, market and industry. We present here a paradigm of the digital home as organic ecosystem - a hierarchical organization of digital servants modeled after the Victorian manor. Using this paradigm we predict some major developments and new business models and opportunities. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) provides huge opportunities for organisations developing new business models supported by interconnected product, service and software systems. Due to the complexity of IoT systems, the understanding and development of attractive new system functions is a great challenge compared with traditional, stand-alone product systems. Methods that focus on the integration of market and business analysis with product design and development emerged from Japan in the late 1960s under the title of Quality Function Deployment (QFD). These have undergone considerable development over the last 30 years to ensure they are appropriate for the development of both complex hardware, software and service systems and the current best practices are described in the recently published ISO 16355 for QFD. Recent significant progress in development of cognitive artificial intelligence (AI) systems such as IBM's Watson system, provides opportunities to gather and analyse significant volumes of market and technological information to support the core objectives of QFD i.e. aligning new product system design to customer and stakeholder priorities. This involves targeting information sources, refining analysis algorithms to ensure market priorities with associated underlying trends are identified reliably. In this paper, background concepts related to QFD are discussed and the areas where cognitive AI can have most significant impact on the QFD approach towards design and development of IoT systems will be covered. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Smart Industries, known as Industry 4.0, are becoming very important for researchers, manufacturers, and media since 2011. The globalization of the markets and mass customization force enterprises to review their business models as well as their manufacturing practices in order to improve their competitiveness. Digital technologies, service-oriented approaches, and process automation lead to more agility, efficiency, performance, and improvement within enterprises. The purpose of this paper is to provide a portrait of Quebec SMEs in order to understand their strengths and weaknesses, and to measure their readiness to keep up with Industry 4.0. A literature review and an analysis based on a database of 148 Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) in Quebec showed that a sustained sharing of knowledge between academics and manufacturers as well as the adoption of incentive and investment policies in digital technologies would aid in better developing the manufacturing sector in Quebec.},

abstract={Within the concept of Industry 4.0 the expansion of mechatronic products towards smart products is key. Whereas the discussion about smart products in the context of production is more prominent, the shift towards the paradigm of smart products also suggests that the current way of product development needs to be adapted fundamentally. It becomes obvious that besides technological topics like big-data or IT-infrastructure, the human factor is of major importance for a successful realization of industry 4.0. Especially new concepts for training and further education for product development are needed to cope with the emerging challenges. In order to design new educational concepts, instructional goals are key. Nowadays these goals are described in a competence oriented way. Until now, there are now competence models available that consider both the specificity of product development as well as the context of Smart Products. Hence this paper aims at deriving this competence model in a conceptual way. Therefore, a multistaged approach is conducted that synthesizes competence models for product development and engineering for industry 4.0 as well as design methodologies in the field.},

abstract={Companies are currently preparing for the fourth industrial revolution, which is envisioned to radically change manufacturing processes, logistics and business models in global manufacturing networks. Previous research have emphasized the need to respond to the changing landscape of the digital economy in dynamic and innovative ways. This study aims at exploring how small and medium-sized companies are prepared to meet this opportunity and challenge. In order to do this we have applied insights from innovation theories and empirical findings from eight companies that are part of two industrial clusters. The findings in this study indicate that even though most of the case companies have ambitions to position themselves in a new digital landscape, they prepare themselves differently. We see that organizations that has progressed furthest in implementing Industry 4.0 related concepts are the ones that make actively use of their external network in cooperation and sharing knowledge. These companies also have managed the balance between exploration and exploitation internally, where employees are both engaged in efficient manufacturing of existing products and product development. Consequently, we claim that both openness and organizational ambidexterity is vital for successful implementation of Industry 4.0. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2017.},

abstract={The variety of products connected to the internet by the Internet of Things (IoT) is rapidly increasing. These products range from industry to consumer products; in fact, a virtual majority of products is expected to become IoT devices in the near future. However, because the information given by these IoT devices is only used by their owners, the term "intranet of things" appears to be more appropriate. For IoT to truly become the Fourth Industrial Revolution, this closed intranet-based architecture has to be changed to an internet-based architecture. EverySense is a new concept IoT market platform that provides end-to-end IoT to improve the business scene of ICT [1]. The EverySense market platform provides a matching mechanism between data provider and data collector with device-independent interoperability. A sharing economy mechanism with high privacy protection is also provided.

abstract={The term "Industrie 4.0" denotes the advent of the fourth industrial revolution which will be characterized by the optimized and networked use of information across the complete life cycles of both products and production assets. The exploitation of Industrie 4.0 paradigms in terms of economic benefit, flexibility and better-informed decision taking requires the availability and provision of adequate information across all engineering and production value chains in an interoperable way, preferably based upon international standards. Up to now, a hierarchical structure of information technology (IT) systems, the so-called automation pyramid, is predominant in industrial production environments. This leads to a separation of office and production networks that shield the safety- and real-time critical field and controller level from inadequate access from upper levels and remote users. Now, with the application of the paradigms of the Internet of Things and Services (IoTS), there is an architectural trend towards a mash-up of networked smart devices and services, deployed within and across enterprises in order to enable new higher-level services and business models such as smart maintenance. This contribution considers this architectural IT paradigm shift from a risk management perspective. © 2016 CURRAN-CONFERENCE. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Business Process as a Service, not yet a determined taxonomy definition and computing model seems to be the next generation to free businesses and IT departments from having to worry to underlying services that support the various processes. In general, a conceptual definition of this model share equal acceptance from the private and public sector, as the entirely worldwide businesses are hoping it soon will become a model of adoption to measure services in the cloud, although it contains the lesser known and discussed cloud categories; basically its ability to directly impact short-term business transformation and perceivable business value to end-users is catching the market. However, this new business model aside from the development of Information, Communication Technology and Industrial Revolution is attracting the boundaries of Port Logistics, a single part of the biggest Maritime Industry sector; as it is undergoing with a vigorous change in terms of strategy to reduce costs, optimize the business process and maximize profits in the future sustainability scenario. In this research, the authors focus on the Business Process as a Service and how it can be used into Port Logistics industry, to begin the researches provide a literature review, analyze, develop a mathematical approach of Total Cost of Ownership and evaluate the same case study under the applicability of Business Process as a Service in order to emphasize which challenges and opportunities Port Logistics need to take in account before these hubs make plans for expanding its growth, competitive advantages and benefits of its applicability. The results shown in this study certainly prompted flexibility, agility and business impact. IJER © 2015 Serials Publications.},

abstract={For professionals at the beginning of the 21 st century, much of the conventional wisdom on business management and engineering is founded in the 20 th century industrial / manufacturing paradigm. In developed economies, however, the service sector now dominates the manufacturing sector, just as manufacturing prevailed over the agricultural sector after the industrial revolution. Simultaneously, as end products have transitioned from material outputs to information in digital form, traditional business models are under siege. The economic sociology in this new world challenges the integrity of models, methods and interventions successful in an earlier paradigm. Since 2005, IBM has encouraged universities to develop a new field of Services Science, Management and Engineering (SSME). Researchers are responding with development of a new science of service systems, but mature foundations will require years of collaboration. In the absence of a well-established science from which educational curricula can be deduced, teachers can develop educational programs for joint learning, guided inductively by relevance and pragmatism. A new seminar on business models - ways in which business organizations operate and evolve - is proposed. Complementing traditional management and/or engineering curricula, this course challenges students to reconsider contexts, surface assumptions and explore alternative approaches to business. With a domain that includes both human and technological parts, systems science serves as a skeleton on which content can be structured.},

abstract={History since the Industrial Revolution shows an accelerating trend of change driven by changes in enabling technologies. Such changes give rise to a Darwinian evolution in commerce. The companies most likely to survive are those which can most quickly adapt to such enabling technologies. The World Wide Web provides a potent infrastructure for dispersed but cooperative information sharing. The emergence of powerful and cheap PCs and broadband communications challenges the orthodox organisation of business models. The possibility of dispersed but tightly integrated companies has become a reality. Individual facilities managers may opt to: plan careers outside FM; compete for the remaining work; seek to develop FM to encompass the changed nature of commerce and the facilities provided. Institutions are not exempt from such changes. Academic qualifications need to be date-stamped. A ten-year old degree may be of little value when a decade of technological progress has eroded its academic base. © 2000, MCB UP Limited},

abstract={It is said that Information Technology (IT) is the second industrial revolution and it effects all businesses. It has especially made great progress by solidifying a series of business model patents in the USA. Attaining the globalization era through IT, friction between IT and domestic culture has increased and the IT revolution increases the burden on our print industry. This has forced us into thinking about the survival of paper from the almighty paper era, though the resistance to IT and E-Commerce (EC) is strong especially in Japan, since IT might have the power to change traditional business customs. So the printing industry must take on three types of revolutionary burdens simultaneously. They consist of the industrial revolution of E-Business, ordering procedures and media. Since the user is the leading component in the IT era, it is necessary to acquire skills in IT or End User Computing (EUC), as its own intellectual infrastructure.
